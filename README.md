## {{Dubious}}

Script for extracting all uses of a given [inline cleanup template][inline] (such as 'dubious' or 'citation-needed' or 'lopsided') from Wikipedia.

"refreshes souls*". Amazing! The [rest of the Cali article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cali) is similarly hilarious. 

The tool is great for finding entertaining pages on Wikipedia like this.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
```

The main script is `index.js`. This incrementally finds usage of a given template and writes them to `out`:

```bash
$ node index.js 'citation-needed'
```

For best results, make sure the template name is listed in `templateAliases`, which gives an alternate set of names for how a template may be used in Wikipedia ([see Wikpedia's inline template documentation][inline] for some template and alias ideas).

Results are saved using [NeDB][nedb] to `output/TEMPLATE_NAME`.
