#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trikonic">Trikonic</a>
- Trikonic, is a technique of triadic analysis-synthesis which has been developed by Gary Richmond based on the original idea of a possible applied science making three categorial distinctions, which philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, its creator, called “Trichotomic.” Peirce introduces trichotomic as the "art of making three-fold divisions” and trikonic is the name given to the electronic trichotomic approach to this science of the trichotomic or triadic analysis of anything which can be so analysed.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- Trikonic is a method that has been developed to assist in certain researches and decision making processes which are of most interest to the virtual community.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- There are many ways in which these notions can be interpreted.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- We can also trikonically analyse thought, by identifying three Logical Modalities<sup>[according to whom]</sup> (Figure 6.
- With these representations in mind, firstness, secondness and thirdness can be defined as the following<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- There are six vectors<sup>[according to whom]</sup> that can be used in trikonic vector analysis; these are shown in Figure 7.
- they are different arrangements of the order of firstness, secondness and thirdness<sup>[according to whom]</sup>.
- You can interpret these in many ways, for example, the Determination Vector and Representation Vector (Please refer to Figure 8.0 and Figure 9.0).<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- the vector process is a graphically logical analysis with aspects of dependence and constraint, and correlation, which tie in with the "living" reflection of the categories by the semiotic triad.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- The reasoning behind the vector analysis is to use the permutations within the triad for the theory and any actual semiosis, mostly the analysis of complex virtual communicative projects.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- However, there has been investigation into whether trikonic can be applied to HCI related issues.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- Especially, those issues concerned with websites and culture, trikonic analysis using the Peircean Category Theory has been used to analyse how trust is invoked in a user when using websites.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
- One of the purposes of trikonic is to explore whether it can help to identify what elements of a website actually influence the user to perceive it to be credible or not.<sup>[according to whom]</sup>
