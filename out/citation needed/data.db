16 November 1768 – 24 July 1817), founded modern Serbia as the elected leader of the First Serbian Uprising (part of the Serbian Revolution) that aimed at liberating Serbia from the Ottoman Empire (1804–1813); he personally led armies against the Ottomans in several battles, which resulted in a short-lived state which he would administer as Grand Leader (Veliki Vožd) from 14 February 1804 to 21 September 1813, alongside the newly founded People's Assembly and the Governing Council, simulating a wholly functional state government in war-time.*","He commanded a unit and fought the Ottomans until 1794, when he returned to his family.*","Some 300 nobility assembled and elected Karađorđe as leader; by the end of the year the janissaries were defeated, and the Sultan praised the Serbs.*","However, when the pasha arrived in Serbia to take over the governance, he was killed.*","The struggle continued as a wide-scale revolt, the First Serbian Uprising, in which several battles were successfully fought against the Ottomans; a government was established, and Karađorđe abolished feudalism.*","After the suppression of activities in 1813, Karađorđe and other leaders went into exile, while in 1815 Miloš Obrenović, a fellow rebel leader, initiated the Second Serbian Uprising.*","When Karađorđe returned in 1817 to start yet another uprising, he was deceived by a friend and killed; his head was sent to Constantinople and Obrenović retained his leadership.*","His family was poor, their situation progressed as Karađorđe began working for affluent Serbs and Turks.*","He and his father worked for a Fazlibaša, an Albanian who had enriched himself from robbing merchants, and who had bought a big house in Smederevska Palanka.*","His family then moved to Zagorica, where he married Jelena Jovanović, from Masloševo, in 1785.*","Karađorđe took her and married her without the parents' consent.*","However, he did not have peace at home as people started talking about his murder, thus Karađorđe saw crossing the Sava river, into Syrmia, in the Austrian-held Military Frontier, as the only chance of saving his family.*","The decline of Hajduks came in 1793-94, at which point Karađorđe rejoined his family, living peacefully in Topola.*","Oppression against Serbs significantly increased in the beginning of the 19th century when janissary leaders, the dahis, rebelled against the Sultan and seized the rule of the Sanjak of Smederevo.*","The Serbians managed to quickly organize a widespread revolt, under the pretext of liberation from the dahis, Karađorđe was successful in this, he terminated feudalism in the liberated areas of Serbia and installed his military commanders and local leaders as governors of nahis (administrative units), the dahis who refused to leave were captured and executed after the Serbian liberation of Belgrade.*","In March 1805, Karađorđe was officially appointed Military leader of Serbia, the self-proclaimed Vožd (old Serbian for vođa, \"leader\").*","The Ottoman government welcomed the rebellion against the dahis and decided to install a new governor in Belgrade.*","Karađorđe, after tasting the fruits of liberty, decided not to let the new pasha enter the liberated area and defeated his army in the Battle of Ivankovac of 1805.*","This battle signified a turn of events, since the uprising was not a rebellion against the dahi terror anymore, but a war of liberation against the Ottoman rule.*","In 1806-1807 a Serbian envoy to the Ottoman government in Constantinople, Peter Ichko, managed to obtain a favourable Ichko's Peace.*","However, Karađorđe disavowed the agreement and aligned with the Russian Empire in a war against the Ottoman Empire.*","In 1808, Selim III was killed by Mustafa IV his successor became Mahmud II.*","In 1812, threatened by Napoleon's French Empire, Russia had to quickly sign a peace treaty with the Ottomans.*","In 1813, the Ottoman Empire launched a big assault on Serbia taking land all up to the rivers Morava and the river Drina, and Karađorđe, along with other rebel leaders, fled to the Austrian Empire on 21 September 1813.*","This happened on the orders of the Ottomans, who feared the possibility of a new uprising, while Miloš feared competition by the enormously popular Karađorđe.*","The assassination marked the beginning of the Obrenović—Karađorđević feud, that ended in 1903.*","During time of peace, he worked the field, as common folk, and once broke his medal.*","He did not give his daughter any privileges during his term as Grand Leader, making her work as everybody else.*","Besides his harsh and emotional side, he was friendly, liked to joke and could take a joke, but it had a limit.*","He was praised by Napoleon for his military skill, and Petar Petrović-Njegoš wrote about him, comparing him to Napoleon, Wellington and Kutuzov, three of the greatest generals of his time.*","Pushkin made a song about him to his daughter and Hegel also wrote about him.*"],"date":1457318768575,"_id":"dfLmP1jNldKzsjdM"}
