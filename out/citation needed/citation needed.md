- The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia.*
- Following the emergence of the circumpolar current in the mid-Oligocene era (some 15 MYA), the Australian climate became increasingly arid, giving rise to a diverse group of arid-specialised organisms, just as the wet tropical and seasonally wet areas gave rise to their own uniquely adapted species.*
- The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and bats and rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record.*
- For example, the top predator in Australia, the Tasmanian tiger, bore a striking resemblance to canids such as the gray wolf;* gliding possums and flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle; and the numbat and anteaters are both digging insectivores.

- These membranes, when outstretched, allow them to glide between trees.*
- Bats and rodents are relatively recent arrivals to Australia; bats are present in the fossil record only from as recently as 15 MYA, and probably arrived from Asia.*
- There are only two endemic genera of bats, although 7% of the world's bats species live in Australia.*
- The old endemics are represented by 14 extant genera.*
- Australia and its territories are home to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand.*
- Relatively recent colonists from Eurasia are swallows,* larks, thrushes, cisticolas, sunbirds, and some raptors, including the large wedge-tailed eagle.

- A number of bird species have been introduced by humans; some, like the European goldfinch and greenfinch, coexist happily with Australian species,* while others, such as the common starling, common blackbird, house sparrow and Indian mynah, are destructive of some native bird species and thus destabilise the native ecosystem.

- Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae.*
- Two species of endangered freshwater shark are found in the Northern Territory.*
- The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.*
- There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters,* including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.
- There are 11 venomous species of stingray,* the largest of which is the smooth stingray.
- There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark.*
- Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement.*
- The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered.*
- The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species* including butterflies and moths, and around 14,800 species of Hymenoptera, including the ants, bees and wasps.
- Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species* of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids.
- Australia has a wide variety of arachnids, including 135 species of spider familiar enough to have common names.*
- In the Annelida (sub)class Oligochaeta there are many families of aquatic worms, and for native terrestrial worms: the Enchytraeidae (pot worms) and the "true" earthworms in families Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae and Megascolecidae.*
- The large family Parastacidae includes 124 species of Australian freshwater crayfish.*
- A huge variety of marine invertebrates are found in Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef an important source of this diversity.*
- Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail,* which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans.
- This presents a serious reef management issue.*
- Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster.*
- Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.*
- The best-known class, to which all the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War">Greek Civil War</a>
- Western leaders (Winston Churchill in particular) encouraged and even coerced* King George II of Greece to appoint a moderate cabinet.
- The communist leaders of EAM, however, had planned to dominate in postwar Greece, so, usually by force, they tried to take over or destroy the other Greek resistance groups (such as the destruction of National and Social Liberation (EKKA) and the murder of its leader, Dimitrios Psarros by ELAS partisans)* and undertaking a campaign of Red Terror.
- Although controlled by the KKE, the organization had democratic republican rhetoric.*
- The Greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations, and by 1943, the Axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads, leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance.*
- EAM-ELAS in particular controlled most of the country's mountainous interior, while EDES was limited to Epirus and EKKA to eastern Central Greece.*
- By early 1944 ELAS could call on nearly 25,000 men under arms, with another 80,000 working as reserves or logistical support, EDES roughly 10,000 men, and EKKA under 10,000 men.*
- The role of the British military mission in these events proved decisive.*
- Consequently, British material support was directed mostly to the more reliable Zervas, who by 1943 had reversed his earlier anti-monarchist stance.*
- They declined to join the ranks of ELAS and were systematically murdered by the Communists*.
- Its political network (EAM) had reached about 500,000 citizens around the country.*
- After a battle there between ELAS and the Security Battalions, ELAS forces prevailed, and the remaining forces of the collaborators were taken into custody.*
- Approximately 5,000 Greek soldiers and officers were sent into prison camps in Libya, Sudan, Egypt and South Africa.*
- Farmakis, a member of the Organization X participating in the shootings, described that he heard the head of the police Angelos Evert giving the order to open fire on the crowd.*
- In certain cases, such as Volos, some RAF units even surrendered equipment to ELAS fighters.*
- It seems that the ELAS preferred to avoid an armed confrontation with the British forces initially and later tried to reduce the conflict as much as possible although poor communication between its very independent units around the country might also have played a role.*
- If not, he could use British actions in Greece to justify similar actions in countries in his own sphere of influence.*
- Despite the severe defeat, ELAS continued to exist, and the KKE had an opportunity to reconsider its strategy.*
- The hunting of "collaborators" was extended to people who were supporting the Greek government.*
- After the ceasefire, ELAS under the leadership of Siantos left Athens, taking thousands of captives.*
- There were dissenters uch as former ELAS leader Aris Velouchiotis.*
- The gangs admitted that they were "retaliating" for their suffering under ELAS rule.*
- For several decades to come, the US ambassador advised the king on important issues, such as the appointment of the prime minister.*
- During the war, more than 25,000 children, most with parents in the DSE, were also placed in 30 "child towns" under the immediate control of Queen Frederika, something especially emphasised by the left.*
- According to some historians,* the KKE's major supporter and supplier had always been Tito, and it was the rift between Tito and the KKE that marked the real demise of the party's efforts to assert power.
- The Civil War left Greece in ruins and in even greater economic distress than it had been following the end of German occupation.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacian_language">Dacian language</a>
- There is thus considerable support for the thesis that Dacian developed in the Carpathian region during the third millennium BC, although its evolutionary pathways remains uncertain.*
- Some may derive from other little-known ancient languages at some time spoken in Dacia or Moesia: for example, the Iranian Sarmatian, or the Turkic Pannonian Avar, Bulgar or Cuman languages,* or, conceivably, some unknown pre-Indo-European language(s) of the Carpathians or Balkans.
- Some may derive from other little-known ancient languages at some time spoken in Dacia or Moesia: for example, the Iranian Sarmatian, or the Turkic Pannonian Avar, Bulgar or Cuman languages, or, conceivably, some unknown pre-Indo-European language(s) of the Carpathians or Balkans.*
- Dacian was probably one of the major languages of south-eastern Europe, spoken in the area between modern-day eastern Hungary to the Black Sea shore.*
- Although Strabo appears to portray these campaigns as short-term raids for plunder and to punish his enemies, several Romanian scholars have argued, on the basis of controversial interpretation of archaeological data, that they resulted in longer-term Dacian occupation and settlement of large territories beyond the dava zone.*
- 60 – 44 BC – and Ptolemy's location of two -dava placenames on the lower Vistula river in Poland.*
- The settlement names ending in these suffixes are geographically grouped as follows:*
- Some of these are: Acmonia, Aizis, Amutria, Apulon, Arcina, Arcobadara, Arutela, Berzobis, Brucla, Diacum, Dierna, Dinogetia, Drobeta, Egeta, Genucla, Malva (Romula), Napoca, Oescus, Patruissa, Pinon, Potaissa, Ratiaria, Sarmizegetusa, Tapae, Tibiscum, Tirista, Tsierna, Tyrida, Zaldapa, Zeugma and Zurobara.*
- Phonologically Dacian is a conservative Indo-European (IE) language.*
- From the remaining fragments, the sound changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Dacian can be grouped as follows:*
- In other words, the isogloss is worthless as a tool to determine the genetic descent of IE languages.*
- However, even if such reconstructions are accepted as valid, an insufficient quantity of words have been reconstructed in each language to establish that they were unrelated.*
- Venetic and Phrygian are considered centum languages, and this may mean that Georgiev, like many other paleolinguists, viewed Illyrian as probably being a centum language* with Daco-Moesian admixture.
- About 300 words in Eastern Romance languages, Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, may derive from Dacian, and many of these show a satem-reflex.*
- 500–1300), and finally to be imported into the Romanian language, when the latter became the predominant language in the region (which does not appear to have occurred before the 13th or 14th century*).
- In contrast, Slavic has a far stronger claim to constitute the substratum of Romanian,* because 10–15% of the Romanian lexicon, numerous grammatical features, and a majority of Romanian placenames, are of Slavic origin, or of pre-Slavic origin transmitted through Slavic forms: see Slavic influence on Romanian and Romanian place names).

- The first Roman conquest of part of Dacia did not extinguish the language, as Free Dacian tribes may have continued to speak Dacian in the area north-east of the Carpathians as late as the 6th or 7th century AD.*
- Another hypothesis (Marius) considers Albanian to be a Daco-Moesian dialect that split off from Dacian before 300 BC and that Dacian itself became extinct.*
- In this scenario, Albanian/Romanian cognates are either Daco-Moesian loanwords acquired by Albanian, or, more likely, Illyrian loanwords acquired by Romanian.*
- However, Romanian substratum words shared with Albanian show a Romanian /a/ that corresponds to an Albanian /o/ when the source of both sounds is an original common /aː/ (mazăre / modhull &lt; *maːdzula 'pea', raţă / rosë &lt; *raːtjaː 'duck'), indicating that when these words had the same common form in Pre-Romanian and Proto-Albanian, the transformation PAlb /aː/ &gt; PAlb /o/ had not yet begun.*
- The correlation between these two theories indicates that the hypothetical split between the pre-Roman Dacians, who were later Romanised, and Proto-Albanian happened before the Romans arrived in the Balkans.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaziranga_National_Park">Kaziranga National Park</a>
- The history of Kaziranga as a protected area can be traced back to 1904, when Mary Curzon, Baroness Curzon of Kedleston, the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, visited the area.*
- In 1916, it was redesignated the "Kaziranga Game Sanctuary" and remained so till 1938, when hunting was prohibited and visitors were permitted to enter the park.*
- Stracey, the forest conservationist, in order to rid the name of hunting connotations.*
- In 1954, the government of Assam passed the Assam (Rhinoceros) Bill, which imposed heavy penalties for rhinoceros poaching.*
- Encroachment by people along the periphery has also led to a diminished forest cover and a loss of habitat.*
- This match was not acceptable to their families, and the couple disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again, and the forest was named after them.*
- Among the Karbis, Kajir is a common name for a girl child,* and it was believed that a woman named Kajir once ruled over the area.
- Kaziranga is located between latitudes 26°30' N and 26°45' N, and longitudes 93°08' E to 93°36' E within two districts in the Indian state of Assam—the Kaliabor subdivision of Nagaon district and the Bokakhat subdivision of Golaghat district.*
- Kaziranga has flat expanses of fertile, alluvial soil, formed by erosion and silt deposition by the River Brahmaputra.*
- The landscape consists of exposed sandbars, riverine flood-formed lakes known as, beels, (which make up 5% of the surface area),* and elevated regions known as, chapories, which provide retreats and shelter for animals during floods.
- Kaziranga contains significant breeding populations of 35 mammalian species, of which 15 are threatened as per the IUCN Red List.*
- Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, Indian gray mongoose, small Indian mongooses, large Indian civet, small Indian civets, Bengal fox, golden jackal, sloth bear, Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolins, hog badger, Chinese ferret badgers, and particoloured flying squirrel.*
- Prominent among them are the Assamese macaque, capped and golden langur, as well as the only ape found in India, the hoolock gibbon.*
- Kaziranga's rivers are also home to the endangered Ganges dolphin.*
- Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds.*
- Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees—dominant species including kumbhi, Indian gooseberry, the cotton tree (in savanna woodlands), and elephant apple (in inundated grasslands).*
- The invasive water hyacinth is very common, often choking the water bodies, but it is cleared during destructive floods.*
- To escape the water-logged areas, many animals migrate to elevated regions outside the park boundaries where they are susceptible to hunting, hit by speeding vehicles, or subject to reprisals by villagers for damaging their crops.*
- To mitigate the losses, the authorities have increased patrols, purchased additional speedboats for patrol, and created artificial highlands for shelter.*
- To prevent the spread of diseases and to maintain the genetic distinctness of the wild species, systematic steps such as immunization of livestock in surrounding villages and fencing of sensitive areas of the park, which are susceptible to encroachment by local cattle, are undertaken periodically.*
- To control the growth and irradiation of invasive species, research on biological methods for controlling weeds, manual uprooting and weeding before seed settling are carried out at regular intervals.*
- Visitors are allowed to take their own vehicles when accompanied by guides.*
- Sprague de Camp in 2005.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_fiction">Magic in fiction</a>
- Historically, many writers who have written about fictional magicians, and the readers of such works, have believed that such magic is possible.*
- In most fantasy works, writers tend to depict magic as an innate talent, equivalent to perfect pitch, and there is wide variation on how spontaneously a person or other being with such a talent can use it.*
- Talents that occur spontaneously usually need training in order to control their abilities.*
- Those who use such spontaneously generated powers are usually not called magicians or similar terms, those being reserved usually for those who have to learn to wield magic.*
- Some works treat magic as a force that is acquired through studying books and tomes.*
- Works which feature this concept usually include a school where magic is taught as a main setting.*
- Magic may also be gained by having it bestowed upon one by another,* either through a pact with a devil or with other spirits, as is common in folklore.
- In some cases, the demon may only provide the means for the would-be wizard to learn magic,* or the pact may be for the devil to do the magic on the wizard's behalf, forcing the wizard to compel it to act.

- Some works feature magic that is tied to a certain area, such as an enchanted forest or an ancient battlefield.*
- Such places are usually the homes of powerful magical beings.*
- In these works, magic can only be accessed and performed in the area in question and runs out when all of the magic in the area is used up.*
- Various techniques are used by fantasy writers to limit the amount of magic in a story, such as limiting the amount of spells a character has, restricting a character's magic through the use of an object, limiting magic to the use of certain materials and making the materials hard to find, restricting the amount of magic a character can use due to the consequences of using it, and limiting the amount of magic a character has.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_theology">Seventh-day Adventist theology</a>
- According to Ed Christian, former JATS editor, "few if any ATS members believe in verbal inerrancy".*
- This was particularly true in the early days of the movement, when it was assumed that most people the church witnessed to were already Christian to begin with, and that they already understood the gospel.*
- The Sabbath is also a time for Adventists to spend with other people and with God.*
- It should be noted, however, that although Seventh-day Adventists do not believe that they are saved by keeping Saturday as the Sabbath, they attach considerably greater significance to Saturday-Sabbath keeping than other denominations attach to worship on Sunday.*
- The Sabbath commandment is seen as an act of faith in God's ideal for the believer, although its significance may not be seen by non-believers.*
- They believe that the Sabbath is a whole day dedicated for worship and fellowship with believers, laying aside non-religious projects and labor.*
- This change became more universally accepted with the establishment of Roman emperor Constantine's Sunday law of 321 AD and the decree at the Council of Laodicea that in canon 29 declared that Christians should avoid work on Sunday.*
- God has permitted Lucifer's rebellion to continue on Earth in order to demonstrate to angels and beings on other worlds that his Law is righteous and necessary, and that the breaking of the 10 commandments leads to moral catastrophe.*
- White, particularly chapter 29, The Origin of Evil is also sometimes referenced.*
- Adventists hold that Christ ministered his blood in the first section of the sanctuary (the holy place) until October 1844; after that time he entered the second section of the sanctuary (the Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies) in fulfillment of the Day of Atonement.*
- Adventists therefore believe that Christ's work of atonement encompasses both his death on the Cross and his ministration in the heavenly sanctuary.*
- Adventists believe that the unrighteous, or wicked, will be raised after the millennium.*
- The time of trouble will be ended by the glorious appearing of Christ, which will also mark the commencement of the millennium.*
- A further difference is that the millennial reign of Christ will take place in heaven, not on earth, and will involve all of the redeemed people of God, not just national Israel.*
- Seventh-day Adventism interprets the book of Revelation using the historicist method, but also holds that some of the events it predicts are still future (see: interpretations of the Book of Revelation).*
- These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.*
- The theological term for this teaching is Annihilationism.*
- Adventist education hence strives to be holistic in nature, involving not just the mind but all aspects of a person.*
- Whatever the prominence assigned to her writings for doctrinal authority, Adventists are agreed that the Bible takes precedence as the final authority.*
- Waggoner brought a focus of the biblical doctrine of the Godhead in part because of the emphasis on Jesus and the plan of salvation as presented after 1888.*

- The discipline and courage of its citizens - linking arms and singing in the face of tanks and armour-piercing bullets - avoided a much greater loss of life and showed the world that Lithuania's citizens were prepared to defend national independence.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Solipsism</a>
- Based on a philosophy of subjective idealism, metaphysical solipsists maintain that the self is the only existing reality and that all other reality, including the external world and other persons, are representations of that self, and have no independent existence.*
- Epistemological solipsists claim that realism requires the question: assuming that there is a universe independent of an agent's mind and knowable only through the agent's senses, how is the existence of this independent universe to be scientifically studied?* If a person sets up a camera to photograph the moon when he is not looking at it, then at best he determines that there is an image of the moon in the camera when he eventually looks at it.
- To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question.*
- Methodological solipsism is an agnostic variant of solipsism*.
- It still entertains the points that any induction is fallible and that we may be brains in vats*.
- Descartes' cartesian skepticism).*
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise* brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist.
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist*.
- The experience of a given person is necessarily private to that person.*
- And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since Descartes elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the primary goal of epistemology, whilst also elevating epistemology to "first philosophy".*
- Solipsism is often introduced in the context of relating it to pathological psychological conditions.*
- The lack of ability to prove the existence of other minds does not, in itself, cause the psychiatric condition of detachment from reality.*
- This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that methodology assumes that humans have no access to omniscience and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via scientific and logical conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.*
- The solipsist, however, would be more likely to put one's self (or merely their own mind) in the center, as the only item of reality, with all other beings (and perhaps even their own body) in reality illusions.*
- Taoism* and several interpretations of Buddhism, especially Zen, teach that the distinction between self and universe is arbitrary, merely a habit of perception and an artifact of language.
- After the development of distinct schools of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.*
- On the other hand, solipsism posits the non-existence of the external void right at the beginning, and says that no further inquiry is possible.*

- Within a short walking distance from the Visitor Center are a restaurant, a bookstore, the Murie Science and Learning Center, the Denali National Park railroad depot, and the McKinley National Park Airport.*
- As a result of the danger involved, and because most of the gravel road is only one lane wide, drivers must be trained in procedures for navigating the sharp mountain curves, and yielding the right-of-way to opposing buses and park vehicles.*

- A footprint of a carnivorous theropod had previously been reported in the park.*
- The most famous kettle lake in Denali is Wonder Lake.*
- Because many of the rivers and lakes of Denali are fed by glaciers, glacial silt and cold temperatures slow the metabolism of the fish, preventing them from reaching normal sizes.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus">Simon Magus</a>
- Surviving traditions about Simon appear in orthodox texts, such as those of Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius, where he is often regarded as the source of all heresies*.
- According to the early church heresiologists, Simon is also supposed to have written several lost treatises, two of which bear the titles The Four Quarters of the World and The Sermons of the Refuter.*
- In apocryphal works including the Acts of Peter, Pseudo-Clementines, and the Epistle of the Apostles, Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will.*
- The different sources for information on Simon contain quite different pictures of him, so much so that it has been questioned whether they all refer to the same person.*
- Some scholars have considered the two to be identical, although this is not generally accepted, as the Simon of Josephus is a Jew rather than a Samaritan.*
- Justin and Irenaeus are the first to recount the myth of Simon and Helen, which became the center of Simonian doctrine.*
- Special to the Simonian tale is the identification of Simon himself with the Supreme, and of his consort Helena with the female principle.*
- Some believe that Hippolytus' account is of a later, more developed form of Simonianism, and that the original doctrines of the group were simpler, close to the account given by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus (this account however is also included in Hippolytus' work).*
- But he also adds, "if any one, on seeing the images either of Simon or Helen, shall call them by those names, he is cast out, as showing ignorance of the mysteries."*
- The Law, according to him, was not of God, but of "the sinister power." The same was the case with the prophets, and it was death to believe in the Old Testament.*
- Cyril of Jerusalem (346 AD) in the sixth of his Catechetical Lectures prefaces his history of the Manichaeans by a brief account of earlier heresies: Simon Magus, he says, had given out that he was going to be translated to heaven, and was actually careening through the air in a chariot drawn by demons when Peter and Paul knelt down and prayed, and their prayers brought him to earth a mangled corpse.*
- They are of uncertain date and authorship, and seem to have been worked over by several hands in the interest of diverse forms of belief.*
- He did indeed preach righteousness and judgment to come.*
- A description is given of how he made a familiar spirit for himself by conjuring the soul out of a boy and keeping his image in his bedroom, and many instances of his feats of magic are given.*

- Other groups were also represented, for example among the Tolpuddle Martyrs, were a number of Methodists.*
- Islam was not a significant minority in this period.*
- Further waves of migration and the gradual repeal of the White Australia Policy helped to reshape the profile of Australia's religious affiliations over subsequent decades.*
- The impact of migration from Europe in the aftermath of World War II led to increases in affiliates of the Orthodox churches, the establishment of Reformed bodies, growth in the number of Catholics (largely from Italian migration) and Jews (Holocaust survivors) and the creation of ethnic parishes among many other denominations.*
- As has been the trend throughout the world since the 11 September attacks, there has been an increasingly strained relationship between the adherents of Islam and the wider community.*
- However, the influence of the identity politics as a whole is not to be discounted in this respects; reflected in the conflicting and ambiguous interpretation of the 2005 race riots in Cronulla near Sydney.*
- However, European Muslims from Albania and Bosnia did arrive in numbers especially in the 1920s and 1930s.*
- Although the first definite cases of Buddhist settlement in Australia were in 1848, there has been speculation from some anthropologists that there may have been contact some hundreds of years earlier.*

- After the war he continued to develop his style in new directions, and under his wing, singers such as Sotiria Bellou, Stella Haskil, Marika Ninou and Prodromos Tsaousakis made their appearance.*
- Chiotis was already a seemingly fully-fledged virtuoso on the traditional 3-course instrument by his teens, but the guitar-based tuning of his new instrument, in combination with his playful delight in extreme virtuosity, led to new concepts of bouzouki playing which came to define the style used in laïki mousiki and other forms of bouzouki music which could no longer really be called rebetiko in any sense.*
- Kazantzidis went on to become a star of the emerging laiki music.*
- From 1960 onwards prominent Greek composers such as Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hatzidakis employed bouzouki virtuosi such as Manolis Chiotis, Giorgos Zambetas, and Thanassis Polyhandriotis in their recordings.*
- This was perhaps because rebetiko lyrics, although seldom directly political, were easily construed as subversive by the nature of their subject matter and their association in popular memory with previous periods of conflict.*
- The genre is a subject of growing international research, and its popularity outside Greece is now well-established.*
- From the latter years of the second decade of the century there exist a number of recordings that can be considered as rebetiko, a few years before such songs began to appear on recordings in Greece.*
- Even songs originally recorded with typical bouzouki-baglamas-guitar accompaniment could appear in Anatolian garments.*
- Prominent among them were Ioannis Papaioannou, Manolis Chiotis, Vassilis Tsitsanis, Iordanis Tsomidis, Roza Eskenazi, Stratos Pagioumdzis, Stavros Tzouanakos, and Giannis Tatasopoulos, of whom the latter three died in the United States.*

- He spent all of 2002 playing for the BayBears.*
- In addition he finished the season with a 13–7 record, 2.88 ERA, a strikeout-to-walk ratio of over 4:1 and WHIP of 1.044.*
- As the game one starter, Peavy had a much stronger outing than his 2005 playoff game, but the Padres again lost to the Cardinals.*
- On August 2, Peavy struck out Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Jeff DaVanon, for his 1000th career strikeout.*
- Over that six-year period Peavy collected two strikeout champion awards, two major league ERA titles, and a unanimous, triple-crown Cy Young Award.*
- He ended 2008 with only a 10–11 record, but had one of the lowest run support per start of any pitcher in the league, and finished the season with a 2.85 ERA.*
- The Astros and Cardinals decided they would not pursue Peavy after talking with GM Kevin Towers on what they would have to give up.*
- The Padres wanted the two top prospects in the organization as well, pitcher Tommy Hanson and outfielder Jordan Schafer, but after a few weeks, the Braves decided to move on to bring in a few free agents.*
- At the time of his injury, Peavy was 6–6 with 3.96 ERA and 92 strikeouts.*
- In his 2009 stint with the White Sox he shut out the Detroit Tigers on two occasions.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Cornwall">Culture of Cornwall</a>
- Although less than 1% of Cornwall's population speak the language and 'mother tongue' speakers are in their hundreds rather than thousands, the language continues to play a significant part in the culture of Cornwall.*
- Historic records of authentic Cornish mythology or history are hard to verify but the earliest Cornish language (such as the Bodmin manumissions) marks the separation of Primitive Cornish from Old Welsh often dated to the Battle of Deorham in 577.*
- Due to language erosion and possible suppression caused by the dominant English language* and culture in the later medieval period, many works of Cornish language are thought to have been lost, particularly at the time of the dissolution of the religious houses of (Glasney College and Crantock College for example), which were regarded as repertories of 'Welsh' (i.

- By the Shakespearean period, these ancient texts still maintained a currency demonstrated by King Lear based on the ancient tale of Leir of Britain which names Corineus the eponymous founder of the Cornish nation; he traditionally wrestled the giant Goemagot into the sea at Plymouth Hoe and claimed the land beyond for his people; the probable origin of the tale of Jack the Giant Killer.*
- Writing in the Cornish dialect has generally been overshadowed by the Cornish language*.
- However, from the 19th century onwards poems and short stories have been published, often with a typically Cornish humour*.
- Then there are literary works in standard English including conversations between dialect speakers.*
- Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the Cornish language.*
- The Cornish and Breton languages were mutually intelligible until Tudor times* and there were many Bretons living in Cornwall before the Prayer Book Rebellion.
- Whist and pub quizzes are also popular in many villages.*
- The Cornish film industry is supported by organisations such as War-rag (War-rag meaning "ahead" in Cornish).*
- However, although it did not become as popular as was hoped,* it was nominated for Best Feature Length Film at the 2002 Celtic Film and Television Festival.
- Fragments of tartan have been found in Penwith.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol">Estradiol</a>
- One principle pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy derivative, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and then to Δ4-androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations.*
- Action of aromatase on Δ4-androstenedione generates estrone, and action of a dehydrogenase on this gives the title compound, 17β-estradiol.*
- Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.*
- Fat structure and skin composition are modified by estradiol.*
- It affects the production of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting.*
- In addition, several benign gynecologic conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, and uterine bleeding.*
- They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors.*
- This is often prescribed in combination with clomifene.*
- Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.*
- Soybeans are another bean that contains chemicals that act similarly to estrogen in the human body and also cause such interactions.*
- As the name implies, estradiol, sometimes abbreviated as E2, has two hydroxyl groups in its molecular structure; its relatives estrone (E1) and estriol (E3) have one and three, respectively, and estetrol (E4) has four.*
- Based on its unique chemical structure, estradiol is about 10 times as potent as estrone and about 80 times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic effect.*
- During the reproductive years of the human female, its serum levels are somewhat higher than that of estrone, except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity.*
- During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, estrone predominates (both based on serum levels).*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitcham,_London">Mitcham, London</a>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>
- Both were descendants from Emperor Otto I by their common grandfather Otto of Worms, son of Liutgarde, one of Otto's daughters.*
- Conrad wanted to reward the archbishop for his electoral support, so he made Aribo chancellor of Italy as well, making Aribo the second most powerful man in the Holy Roman Empire as the imperial chancellor.*
- The political reorientation of Pilgrim also weakened the opposition towards the new king.*
- Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.*
- The reasons for the rebellion are not recorded, but the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive some compensation the king promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election.*
- Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.*
- The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.*
- Conrad energetically continued this tradition.*
- Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the March of Schleswig, the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.*
- Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.*
- This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.*
- Conrad thus left the Mezzogiorno firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.*
- His son Henry was invested with the kingdom of Burgundy.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_device">Wingtip device</a>
- This small contribution can be worthwhile over the aircraft's lifetime, provided the benefit offsets the cost of installing and maintaining the winglets.*
- Light," "Heavy," etc.) because the vortex strength grows with the aircraft lift coefficient, and thus, the associated turbulence is greatest at low speed and high weight.*
- The fence/winglet drives the area where the vortex forms upward away from the wing surface, since the center of the resulting vortex is now at the tip of the winglet.*
- Large winglets such as those seen on Boeing 737 aircraft equipped with blended winglets are most useful during short-distance flights, where increased climb performance offsets increased drag.*
- Learjet's application of winglets to production aircraft continued with newer models including the Learjet 55, 31, 60, 45, and Learjet 40.*
- The airplane gained supplemental type certification in 2003, and the majority of 737s delivered today are equipped with the devices.*
- Sharklets are expected to result in a reduced fuel burn of up to 4 percent over longer sectors, which may correspond to an annual CO2 reduction of around 700 tonnes per aircraft.*
- The A350 and Airbus A320neo family will also make use of winglets rather than wingtip fences.*
- The An-158 also uses wingtip fences.*
- American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, WestJet, airberlin and Ryanair advertise their websites on the inboard side of their 737s' winglets.*
- The benefits are notable, because sailplane winglets must be removable to allow the glider to be stored in a trailer, so they are usually installed only at the pilot's preference.*
- A winglet is also a special case of a non-planar wingtip.*
- Eventually, designers employed multiple non-planar sections, each canting up at a greater angle, dispensing with the winglets entirely.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannadice_Park">Tannadice Park</a>
- The name of the ground was changed to Tannadice when Dundee Hibernian took over the lease in 1909.*
- The Hibs committee made an offer to the landlords which exceeded what Wanderers were paying; as a result, the established tenants were informed that their lease would not be renewed for the coming season.*
- The original capacity of Tannadice Park was around 10,000, the terracings were specially extended and additional temporary seating erected for a Qualifying Cup-tie against Forfar Athletic in 1913; all of this was necessary to allow a record crowd to be accommodated, and the reported attendance was 15,000.*
- This was opened in 1971 and overlooked the pitch, something that is now a common sight in football grounds across the country.*
- Unfortunately the first time the under-soil heating was called into action was when a fairly heavy snowfall started during the UEFA Cup 3rd round first leg tie against Neuchâtel Xamax on 27 November 1985 and the system failed.*
- In 2009, the traditional flood lights were removed and replaced with a brighter roof mounted lighting system, and in 2010 the original wooden seats in the Jerry Kerr stand were removed and replaced with tangerine plastic seating.*
- The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.*
- With season ticket holders now accommodated in the more modern parts of the stadium, the Shed can be allocated to either home or away supporters as demand dictates.*
- It is allocated to home supporters.*
- Cup ties tended to attract higher attendances in this era, and after the terraces were specially extended to accommodate the expected large crowd, 15,000 watched a Scottish Qualifying Cup tie against Forfar Athletic on 1 November 1913.*
- Then a much larger than anticipated crowd of 23,517 packed in to watch an important late season Tayside derby against St Johnstone on 17 April 1926, with both clubs fighting relegation.*
- Since then, in common with many other grounds, safety legislation and conversion to all-seating has drastically reduced Tannadice's capacity, with the modern stadium holding little over half that number.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Operations_Group">14th Operations Group</a>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub">Fansub</a>
- Hard subs have traditionally been more popular than softsubs, due to a lack of player support and worries over plagiarism, but most fansub groups now release a softsub version of their releases.*
- Many of the early digital fansubs were made from regular tape subs.*
- However Hatcher states that copyright law in the United States—the frame of reference for most online discussions of fansub legality—construes translations as derivative, and fansubs infringe on the author's right to prepare derivative works* and to reproduction by copying original source material.
- Past market reactions have shown that time might be better spent petitioning 4Kids for a bilingual release, and supporting the uncut release of former 4Kids licenses like One Piece, to show them there is a market for such titles.*
- After fan demand showed there was a market for the title,* uncut, unedited versions of the show, and Pioneer successfully release the Sailor Moon Movies in a subtitled VHS format in 1999, followed by dubbed versions and bilingual DVDs.
- The lack of buzz that surrounded these titles has been linked by fansub supporters* to MFI's suppression of fan distribution.
- They argue that by cutting off this means of "free advertisement," MFI has alienated fans who would normally buy their products after they were licensed and kept the shows from being as widely exposed as they might otherwise be.*
- The end result, say fansub supporters,* is a reduced interest from American anime companies and a loss of revenue for the studio.
- It took the series over 2 years to be licensed, which was normal for anime licenses around 2002.*
- Fansub opposers claim* that Japanese licensors have reportedly grown discontent with fansubbers because the ease of access with which their works are obtained has begun to affect foreign licensees' willingness to license a series, as evidenced by the Western market's sharp drop in new acquisitions in 2005.
- They also suggest* that anime fans in Japan have reportedly begun to turn to English fansubs which often appear days after a show's release, affecting sales in their home market.

- For non-players, selection is based on positive and lasting contributions to the overall growth and success of poker.*
- While no definitive plans have been announced, WSOP Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack has indicated that in the next one to three years that other venues may start holding WSOP events.*
- At that time, the buy-ins and payouts changed from being fixed in pounds to euros.*
- In 2003 and 2004 DVD sets were released by ESPN of the Main Event.*
- Initial academies were launched in Tunica, Mississippi, Indiana, and Las Vegas.*

- It has also been called "The One", "The Great One", "The Creator", "The Supreme Mind", "The Supreme Good", "The Father" and "The Universal Mother".*
- Freemasonry often includes concepts of God as an external entity, however, esoteric masonic teachings* clearly identify God as the individual himself: the perceiver.
- In the Abrahamic traditions, there are many differences in how these properties are expressed*.
- Some people have illustrated this concept by saying that the Father, Son and Spirit are one yet distinct, in the same way that ice, steam and water are one, yet distinctly different from each other.*
- Binitarians normally believe that God is a family, currently consisting of the Father and the Son*.
- However, the Mormon concept of God has expanded since the faith's founding in the late 1820s.*
- Thus many sages and saints of both monotheistic and other traditions described mystical trances, or raptures and stated they were unable to describe God or their visions fully.*
- Para-Brahman is the all inclusive - he is the head from which all concepts including the alphabets emerge.*
- the universal set of all concepts like mind, intellect, speech, alphabets, etc.) to denote this, a special term - not originating from alphabets - called OM is used.*
- Apara-Brahman is the same Para Brahma but for human understanding thought of as universal mind cum universal intellect from which all human beings derive an iota as their mind, intellect etc.*
- In some traditions of Hinduism it is used to indicate the Supreme Being or Absolute Truth, but with specific reference to that Supreme Being as possessing a personality (a personal God).*

- However, he usually signed his works and there is no signature by him in the bell tower which leads to further speculation.*
- This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.*
- Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.*
- In 1198 clocks were temporarily installed on the third floor of the unfinished construction.*
- Construction was halted again in 1284, when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.*
- The largest one was installed in 1655.*
- His name appears as a witness to the above legacy of Berta di Bernardo as "Master Gerardo", and as a worker whose name was Gerardo.*
- A more probable builder is Diotisalvi, because of the construction period and the structure's affinities with other buildings in Pisa, but he usually signed his works, and there is no signature by him in the bell tower.*
- He could be the same Giovanni Pisano who completed the belfry tower.*
- In 1987 the tower was included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery and cemetery.*

- The government consisted of a Cabinet ministry acting as an advisory board to Subhas Bose, who was given the title "Netaji" (translating roughly to "leader"*) and was no doubt the dominant figure in the Provisional Government.
- He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government* and the army.
- He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government and the army.*
- Bose had shown impatience and displeasure – there was never any question then or later of his absolute authority: the Cabinet had no responsibility and could only tender advice..."*
- In theory the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control.*
- Plans to march towards Delhi,* gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season and the failure to capture Imphal.
- In addition to these setbacks, the INA was faced with a formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend Rangoon* without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944–1945.
- Left to defend* Rangoon from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated.
- Although Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force,* having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the Battle of Imphal.
- However, INA's most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, -which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA's and the Japanese bid to take Imphal.*

- Nevertheless, his tales were regarded as fantasy by later Greek and Roman authorities,* such as the geographer Strabo.
- It was impossible, according to their perception of the world, for man to survive in these 'uninhabitable reaches'.*
- This quickly led to a wave of colonization.*
- While they flourished initially, these settlements eventually foundered due to changing climatic conditions (see Little Ice Age).*
- Modern scholars debate the precise location of the new lands of Vinland, Markland, and Helluland that they discovered.*
- They then founded the settlement of Mangazeya east of the Yamal Peninsula in the early 16th century.*
- Navigators were better able to chart their positions, and the European race to China, sparked by interest in the writings of Marco Polo, commenced.*
- Though England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of Anglo-Spanish War, Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.*
- The vast majority of the route lies in Arctic waters and parts are only free of ice for two months per year, making it a very perilous journey.*
- Although these expeditions failed, new coasts and islands were discovered.*

- Chiang Ching-kuo was officially elected President of the ROC by the National Assembly on May 20, 1978.*
- He was reelected to another term in 1984.*
- At that time, the National Assembly consisted mostly of "ten thousand year" legislators, men who had been elected in 1947-48 before the fall of mainland China and who would hold their seats indefinitely.*
- During the early years of his term in office Chiang maintained many of his father's autocratic policies, continuing to rule Taiwan as a one-party dictatorship under martial law as before.*
- In a move he launched the "Ten Major Construction Projects" and the "Twelve New Development Projects" which contributed to the "Taiwan Miracle." Among his accomplishments was accelerating the process of economic modernization to give Taiwan a 13% growth rate, $4,600 per capita income, and the world's second largest foreign exchange reserves.*
- President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would no longer recognize the ROC as the legitimate government of China.*
- Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States would continue to sell weapons to Taiwan, but the TRA was purposely vague in any promise of defending Taiwan in the event of an invasion.*
- The United States would now end all official contact with the Chiang's government and withdraw its troops from the island.*
- His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls and opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish political criticism papers.*
- When the Democratic Progressive Party was established on 28 September 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders, but its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the Tangwai movement.*

- The fear incited by such threats as well as the concern that no one will believe them or that no one really cares can successfully silence women.*
- Experience of sexual abuse in prison can greatly impede women’s capacity to reintegrate into society upon release.*
- In addition, some states continue to use shackles for security during transportation, labor, delivery, and postpartum care.*
- The use of shackles is highly controversial, reported as both dangerous and inhumane.*
- As a result, it is still common practice in some places.*
- Difficulties with employment, housing, and ostracism can decrease successful transitions and lead to a cycle in and out of prison.*

- Virtual service desk: for organizations having multi-country locations – can be situated and accessed from anywhere in the world due to advances in network performance and telecommunications, reducing operational costs* and improving usage of available resources
- The certification scheme differs between ITIL v2 and ITIL 2007/2011, and bridge examinations (now retired) allowed owners of v2 certificates to transfer to the new program.*
- These rights were obtained from OGC, the British government institution and owner of the ITIL trademark.*
- Now, after signing a contract with EXIN, BCS/ISEB, Loyalist Certification Services [1],PeopleCert Group and other certification bodies, APM Group has accredited them as official examination bodies, to offer ITIL exams and accredit ITIL training providers.*
- Some researchers group ITIL with lean, Six Sigma and Agile software development operations management.*
- Some vendors have also included the term Lean when discussing ITIL implementations, for example "Lean-ITIL".*
- The initial consequences of an ITIL initiative tend to add cost with benefits promised as a future deliverable.*

- In 1285, he embarked on his first mission to North Africa but was expelled from Tunis*.
- Llull travelled to Tunis a second time in about 1304, and wrote numerous letters to the king of Tunis, but little else is known about this part of his life*.
- He finally achieved his goal of linguistic education at major universities in 1311 when the Council of Vienne ordered the creation of chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Chaldean (Aramaic) at the universities of Bologna, Oxford, Paris, and Salamanca as well as at the Papal Court.*
- In 1314, at the age of 82, Llull traveled again to North Africa where he was stoned by an angry crowd of Muslims in the city of Bougie*.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonbridge">Tonbridge</a>
- During World War II a prisoner of war camp was built at the junction of Tudeley Lane and Pembury Road on land belonging to Somerhill.*
- It held German pilots who had been shot down, and captured Italian soldiers.*
- The town has largely retained its 'market town' atmosphere and has many attractions to visitors and residents alike, including the well-maintained Castle Gatehouse, a large country park and activities based around the river.*
- There has been increasing criticism from local residents that there is a relative abundance of restaurants, estate agents, banks and 'cheap' shops, and a lack of major high street retailers.*
- However, there are far fewer empty high street premises than in the mid-1990s, reflecting the town's increasing prosperity.*
- The town traders suffer from its proximity to large shopping centres such as Tunbridge Wells, Maidstone and Bluewater.*
- During the early 20th century Tonbridge became the South East hub for plastic moulding / engineering and printing, with many well-known companies such as The Crystalate Gramophone Record Company, which claimed to be the oldest record producer in Britain.*
- From the early postwar years, Crystalate was very much involved in producing the 1 mini-disc, which was sold in Marks &amp; Spencers, Woolworths and probably other stores for 6d (2.5p) each between 1930 and 1937, with labels such as Crown, Embassy and Eclipse.*

- He was described as a large man, standing about six foot two inches in stocking feet and weighing in the area of 260 pounds with almost no body fat.*
- This was an insult to Crow because the Crow believed the liver to be vital if one was to go on to the afterlife.*
- The story of how he got his name was written down by a diarist at the time.*
- There were three Johnsons ("Pear Loving Johnson", and "Long Toes Johnson"),* nicknames were commonplace, and with Johnson's show of eating the liver, he received his name.
- Many more Indians of different tribes, especially but not limited to the Sioux and the Blackfoot, would know the wrath of "Dapiek Absaroka" Crow killer and his fellow mountain men.*
- The accurate story is told in the diaries of Lee and Kaiser, who were on the Missouri River in 1868 when Johnston was given his moniker, after a rainy fight with the Sioux.*
- He was listed as five foot, eleven and three-quarter inches (1.82 meters) tall according to government records.*
- In his time, he was a sailor, scout, soldier, gold-seeker, hunter, trapper, whiskey-peddler, guide, deputy, constable, builder of log cabins, taking advantage of any source of income-producing labor he could find.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_Christianity">Mormonism and Christianity</a>
- The Mormonism that originated with Joseph Smith in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements of nineteenth-century Protestant Christianity.*
- In traditional Christianity, as expressed in the Athanasian Creed, God is conceived both as a unity and a Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are described as three persons of one uncreated divine being, equally infinite, eternal, and unchangeable.*
- The Prophet has been compared to the Pope in Catholicism because both, within their respective faiths, are regarded as the leading authority.*
- Thus, Mormons believe that non-Mormon clergy have no heavenly authority and that sacraments performed by clergy of other faiths are of no effect in the eyes of God.*
- However, the Community of Christ is engaged in ongoing informal discussions concerning this issue.*
- The Episcopal Church (USA), part of the 80-million-member Anglican Communion, also does not recognize Mormon baptisms, though it recognizes Christian baptisms that are Trinitarian in nature.*
- However, Daniel Tuttle, the Episcopal Church's first bishop of Utah, decided not to require re-baptism of LDS converts, and that practice continues today among most Episcopal clergy.*
- The lessons also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.*
- The release discouraged the use of the term "Mormon Church".*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland">Economy of the Republic of Ireland</a>
- In terms of GNP per capita, a better measure of national income*, Ireland ranks below the OECD average, despite significant growth in recent years, at 10th in the OECD-28 rankings.
- They also speculated in agricultural land which, in 2007, had an average value of €23,600 per acre ($32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.*
- There are 1,200 directly employed in leasing, with Irish lessors managing more than €100 billion in assets.*
- Ireland has 14 of the top 15 lessors by fleet size.*
- This includes approximately 180 companies in areas such of industrial products and services, aerospace, automotive and clean tech.*
- Ireland is the world's second largest exporter of software.*
- State provided old age pensions are also relatively generous in Ireland.*
- The recruitment service industry in Ireland involves specialised recruitment agencies (sometimes known as employment agencies or simply recruiters) offering personnel consulting, specialist corporate recruiting, CV databasing, job-finding and headhunting, and temporary worker management services.*
- In reaction to this several companies are rebranding themselves as Flat Fee recruiters and offer reduced service at reduced fees.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_law">Socialist law</a>
- While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of private property, how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the state or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.*
- Cases of development of common law into Socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).*
- This trend reached its zenith under Joseph Stalin with the ascendancy of Andrey Vyshinsky, when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in special tribunals.*
- Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to decriminalize lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.*
- A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called burlaw court (or, verbally, "court of comrades", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.*
- In some cases (for example in the case of urban residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.*
- Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.*
- The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of social welfare.*
- At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion">Ocean thermal energy conversion</a>
- OTEC has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave power*.
- The alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed, thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costs.*
- The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water (see heat pipe).*
- OTEC has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power, and in conjunction with electrolysis, could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumption.*
- Even at shallower depths, the cost of mooring may be prohibitive.*
- Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.*
- With OTEC plants supplying water, the only cost is for extraction.*

- Patronage of the line fell* when the introduction of fast trains from London to Oxford and Cambridge made it quicker for passengers to go via London.
- During 1982 the entire length of the Bletchley-Oxford section, which was still double-tracked throughout, was used for diversionary passenger services while a bridge at Hill Wooton, between Coventry and Leamington Spa was replaced; all Birmingham-London Paddington services scheduled to stop at Coventry being diverted via this route for three days.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_marketing">Green marketing</a>
- Environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needs.*
- One of green marketing's challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes "green," according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing.*
- This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims.*
- However, despite the growth in the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products.*
- And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.*
- Car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares, to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gases.*

- Labrador's sparse settlement and a local topography similar to parts of the Soviet Union, in addition to proximity to European NATO nations caused CFB Goose Bay to grow and become the primary low-level tactical training area for several NATO air forces during the 1980s.*
- Many protests evolved into dangerous activities, including trespassing into the low-level flying ranges (at detriment of the safety of protesters), and even to shooting hunting rifles at the fighter aircraft.*
- The permanent RNAF detachment left CFB Goose Bay in the 1990s, although temporary training postings have been held since.*
- It was also the first Canadian airport to receive diverted aircraft.*
- The base continues in its role as a low-level tactical training facility and as a forward deployment location for Canadian Forces Air Command, although the total complement of Canadian Forces personnel numbers less than 100.*

- Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.*
- In most countries, including Australia, New Zealand and all of those in Europe,* the "headline" octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI), and often written on pumps as (R+M)/2).
- Due to a new European Union law, gas stations are being required to offer a minimum rate of the new mixture of "Super" 95 RON with up to 10% Ethanol branded as "Super E10".*
- Producers are discontinuing "Super E5" 95 RON with &lt;5% Ethanol* so cars that are unable to use E10 must use 98 RON gasoline automotive fuel instead.
- Shell V-Power is a 97 RON (labelled as 95 due to the legalities of only using 95 or 98 labelling), some independent tests have shown that one year after introduction it was downgraded to 95 RON,* whereas in neighboring Germany Shell V-Power consists of the regular 100 RON fuel.
- Often, filling stations near US racing tracks will offer higher octane levels such as 100 AKI .*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_language">Lombard language</a>
- The two main varieties (Western Lombard dialect and Eastern Lombard dialect) show differences and are often, but not always, mutually comprehensible.*
- Also, dialects from the Piedmontese provinces of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and Novara, the Valsesia valley (province of Vercelli), and the city of Tortona are closer to Western Lombard than to Piedmontese.*
- This is due to a number of historical and social reasons: its usage has been historically discouraged by Italian politicians, probably as it was regarded as an obstacle to the attempt to create a 'national identity', because speaking a non-standard variety is a sign of poor schooling or low social status.*
- Presently the political party most supportive of Lombard (and of the varieties of Northern Italy in general) is the Northern League* (in the past, on the other hand, the leftist parties were the ones giving support to local varieties).
- Presently the political party most supportive of Lombard (and of the varieties of Northern Italy in general) is the Northern League (in the past, on the other hand, the leftist parties were the ones giving support to local varieties).*

- For univariate distributions that are symmetric about one median, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population pseudo-median, which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median.*
- An image constructed of median values of neighborhoods (like 3×3 square) can effectively reduce noise in this case.*
- Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1843 was the first* to use the term median (valeur médiane) for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves.
