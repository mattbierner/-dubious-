#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War">Greek Civil War</a>
- Western leaders (Winston Churchill in particular) encouraged and even coerced* King George II of Greece to appoint a moderate cabinet.
- The communist leaders of EAM, however, had planned to dominate in postwar Greece, so, usually by force, they tried to take over or destroy the other Greek resistance groups (such as the destruction of National and Social Liberation (EKKA) and the murder of its leader, Dimitrios Psarros by ELAS partisans)* and undertaking a campaign of Red Terror.
- Although controlled by the KKE, the organization had democratic republican rhetoric.*
- The Greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations, and by 1943, the Axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads, leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance.*
- EAM-ELAS in particular controlled most of the country's mountainous interior, while EDES was limited to Epirus and EKKA to eastern Central Greece.*
- By early 1944 ELAS could call on nearly 25,000 men under arms, with another 80,000 working as reserves or logistical support, EDES roughly 10,000 men, and EKKA under 10,000 men.*
- The role of the British military mission in these events proved decisive.*
- Consequently, British material support was directed mostly to the more reliable Zervas, who by 1943 had reversed his earlier anti-monarchist stance.*

- In certain cases, such as Volos, some RAF units even surrendered equipment to ELAS fighters.*
- It seems that the ELAS preferred to avoid an armed confrontation with the British forces initially and later tried to reduce the conflict as much as possible although poor communication between its very independent units around the country might also have played a role.*
- If not, he could use British actions in Greece to justify similar actions in countries in his own sphere of influence.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Solipsism</a>
- Based on a philosophy of subjective idealism, metaphysical solipsists maintain that the self is the only existing reality and that all other reality, including the external world and other persons, are representations of that self, and have no independent existence.*
- Epistemological solipsists claim that realism requires the question: assuming that there is a universe independent of an agent's mind and knowable only through the agent's senses, how is the existence of this independent universe to be scientifically studied?* If a person sets up a camera to photograph the moon when he is not looking at it, then at best he determines that there is an image of the moon in the camera when he eventually looks at it.
- To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question.*
- Methodological solipsism is an agnostic variant of solipsism*.
- It still entertains the points that any induction is fallible and that we may be brains in vats*.
- Descartes' cartesian skepticism).*
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise* brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist.
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist*.
- The experience of a given person is necessarily private to that person.*
- And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since Descartes elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the primary goal of epistemology, whilst also elevating epistemology to "first philosophy".*
- Solipsism is often introduced in the context of relating it to pathological psychological conditions.*
- The lack of ability to prove the existence of other minds does not, in itself, cause the psychiatric condition of detachment from reality.*
- This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that methodology assumes that humans have no access to omniscience and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via scientific and logical conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.*
- The solipsist, however, would be more likely to put one's self (or merely their own mind) in the center, as the only item of reality, with all other beings (and perhaps even their own body) in reality illusions.*
- Taoism* and several interpretations of Buddhism, especially Zen, teach that the distinction between self and universe is arbitrary, merely a habit of perception and an artifact of language.
- After the development of distinct schools of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.*
- On the other hand, solipsism posits the non-existence of the external void right at the beginning, and says that no further inquiry is possible.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol">Estradiol</a>
- One principle pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy derivative, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and then to Δ4-androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations.*
- Action of aromatase on Δ4-androstenedione generates estrone, and action of a dehydrogenase on this gives the title compound, 17β-estradiol.*
- Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.*
- Fat structure and skin composition are modified by estradiol.*
- It affects the production of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting.*
- In addition, several benign gynecologic conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, and uterine bleeding.*
- They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors.*
- This is often prescribed in combination with clomifene.*
- Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.*
- Soybeans are another bean that contains chemicals that act similarly to estrogen in the human body and also cause such interactions.*
- As the name implies, estradiol, sometimes abbreviated as E2, has two hydroxyl groups in its molecular structure; its relatives estrone (E1) and estriol (E3) have one and three, respectively, and estetrol (E4) has four.*
- Based on its unique chemical structure, estradiol is about 10 times as potent as estrone and about 80 times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic effect.*
- During the reproductive years of the human female, its serum levels are somewhat higher than that of estrone, except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity.*
- During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, estrone predominates (both based on serum levels).*

- Individuals might ignore and escape secular laws, but they could not do the same with divine laws, if Justinian declared his novels to be such.*
- It was in these fake capitularies where Benedictus utilized Justinian's interpretation as a justification for ecclesiastical supremacy over mundane institutions, thereby demanding* burning at the stake for carnal sins in the name of Charlemagne himself.
- According to Benedictus, this was why all mundane institutions had to be subjected to ecclesiastical power in order to prevent moral as well as religious laxity causing divine wrath.*
- Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice".*
- But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.*

- That is, whether the Masoretic text which forms the basis of most modern English translations of the Old Testament, or translations which pre-date the masoretic text, such as the Septuagint, Syriac Peshitta, and Samaritan Pentateuch are more accurate.*
- Some of the latter have formed sects that have emphasized pacificism as a central tenet of their faith.*
- The earliest objections to incarnation come from Celsus and Porphyry.*
- During Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, important Christian theologians advocated religious persecution to varying degrees.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_marketing">Green marketing</a>
- Environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needs.*
- One of green marketing's challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes "green," according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing.*
- This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">Median</a>
- If data are represented by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distributions, then estimates of the median can be obtained by fitting that family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution.*
- For univariate distributions that are symmetric about one median, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population pseudo-median, which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median.*
- An image constructed of median values of neighborhoods (like 3×3 square) can effectively reduce noise in this case.*
- Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1843 was the first* to use the term median (valeur médiane) for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves.
- Francis Galton used the English term median in 1881, having earlier used the terms middle-most value in 1869 and the medium in 1880.*
