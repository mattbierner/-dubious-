#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara%C4%91or%C4%91e">Karađorđe</a>
- orđe Petrović OSA (Serbian Cyrillic: Ђорђе Петровић, Serbian pronunciation: [d͡ʑôːrd͡ʑe pětroʋit͡ɕ], Anglicized: George Petrovich; known as Karađorđe (Serbian Cyrillic: Карађорђе, [kârad͡ʑoːrd͡ʑe]), Black George (Serbian: Црни Ђорђе / Crni Đorđe) ; 16 November 1768 – 24 July 1817), founded modern Serbia as the elected leader of the First Serbian Uprising (part of the Serbian Revolution) that aimed at liberating Serbia from the Ottoman Empire (1804–1813); he personally led armies against the Ottomans in several battles, which resulted in a short-lived state which he would administer as Grand Leader (Veliki Vožd) from 14 February 1804 to 21 September 1813, alongside the newly founded People's Assembly and the Governing Council, simulating a wholly functional state government in war-time.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He commanded a unit and fought the Ottomans until 1794, when he returned to his family.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some 300 nobility assembled and elected Karađorđe as leader; by the end of the year the janissaries were defeated, and the Sultan praised the Serbs.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, when the pasha arrived in Serbia to take over the governance, he was killed.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The struggle continued as a wide-scale revolt, the First Serbian Uprising, in which several battles were successfully fought against the Ottomans; a government was established, and Karađorđe abolished feudalism.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- After the suppression of activities in 1813, Karađorđe and other leaders went into exile, while in 1815 Miloš Obrenović, a fellow rebel leader, initiated the Second Serbian Uprising.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- When Karađorđe returned in 1817 to start yet another uprising, he was deceived by a friend and killed; his head was sent to Constantinople and Obrenović retained his leadership.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- His family was poor, their situation progressed as Karađorđe began working for affluent Serbs and Turks.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He and his father worked for a Fazlibaša, an Albanian who had enriched himself from robbing merchants, and who had bought a big house in Smederevska Palanka.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- His family then moved to Zagorica, where he married Jelena Jovanović, from Masloševo, in 1785.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Karađorđe took her and married her without the parents' consent.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, he did not have peace at home as people started talking about his murder, thus Karađorđe saw crossing the Sava river, into Syrmia, in the Austrian-held Military Frontier, as the only chance of saving his family.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The decline of Hajduks came in 1793-94, at which point Karađorđe rejoined his family, living peacefully in Topola.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Oppression against Serbs significantly increased in the beginning of the 19th century when janissary leaders, the dahis, rebelled against the Sultan and seized the rule of the Sanjak of Smederevo.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Serbians managed to quickly organize a widespread revolt, under the pretext of liberation from the dahis, Karađorđe was successful in this, he terminated feudalism in the liberated areas of Serbia and installed his military commanders and local leaders as governors of nahis (administrative units), the dahis who refused to leave were captured and executed after the Serbian liberation of Belgrade.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In March 1805, Karađorđe was officially appointed Military leader of Serbia, the self-proclaimed Vožd (old Serbian for vođa, "leader").<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Ottoman government welcomed the rebellion against the dahis and decided to install a new governor in Belgrade.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Karađorđe, after tasting the fruits of liberty, decided not to let the new pasha enter the liberated area and defeated his army in the Battle of Ivankovac of 1805.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This battle signified a turn of events, since the uprising was not a rebellion against the dahi terror anymore, but a war of liberation against the Ottoman rule.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1806-1807 a Serbian envoy to the Ottoman government in Constantinople, Peter Ichko, managed to obtain a favourable Ichko's Peace.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, Karađorđe disavowed the agreement and aligned with the Russian Empire in a war against the Ottoman Empire.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1808, Selim III was killed by Mustafa IV his successor became Mahmud II.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1812, threatened by Napoleon's French Empire, Russia had to quickly sign a peace treaty with the Ottomans.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1813, the Ottoman Empire launched a big assault on Serbia taking land all up to the rivers Morava and the river Drina, and Karađorđe, along with other rebel leaders, fled to the Austrian Empire on 21 September 1813.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This happened on the orders of the Ottomans, who feared the possibility of a new uprising, while Miloš feared competition by the enormously popular Karađorđe.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The assassination marked the beginning of the Obrenović—Karađorđević feud, that ended in 1903.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During time of peace, he worked the field, as common folk, and once broke his medal.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He did not give his daughter any privileges during his term as Grand Leader, making her work as everybody else.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Besides his harsh and emotional side, he was friendly, liked to joke and could take a joke, but it had a limit.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He was praised by Napoleon for his military skill, and Petar Petrović-Njegoš wrote about him, comparing him to Napoleon, Wellington and Kutuzov, three of the greatest generals of his time.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Pushkin made a song about him to his daughter and Hegel also wrote about him.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Western leaders (Winston Churchill in particular) encouraged and even coerced<sup>[citation needed]</sup> King George II of Greece to appoint a moderate cabinet.
- The communist leaders of EAM, however, had planned to dominate in postwar Greece, so, usually by force, they tried to take over or destroy the other Greek resistance groups (such as the destruction of National and Social Liberation (EKKA) and the murder of its leader, Dimitrios Psarros by ELAS partisans)<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and undertaking a campaign of Red Terror.
- Although controlled by the KKE, the organization had democratic republican rhetoric.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations, and by 1943, the Axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads, leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- EAM-ELAS in particular controlled most of the country's mountainous interior, while EDES was limited to Epirus and EKKA to eastern Central Greece.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- By early 1944 ELAS could call on nearly 25,000 men under arms, with another 80,000 working as reserves or logistical support, EDES roughly 10,000 men, and EKKA under 10,000 men.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The role of the British military mission in these events proved decisive.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Consequently, British material support was directed mostly to the more reliable Zervas, who by 1943 had reversed his earlier anti-monarchist stance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- They declined to join the ranks of ELAS and were systematically murdered by the Communists<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- Its political network (EAM) had reached about 500,000 citizens around the country.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Farmakis, a member of the Organization X participating in the shootings, described that he heard the head of the police Angelos Evert giving the order to open fire on the crowd.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In certain cases, such as Volos, some RAF units even surrendered equipment to ELAS fighters.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It seems that the ELAS preferred to avoid an armed confrontation with the British forces initially and later tried to reduce the conflict as much as possible although poor communication between its very independent units around the country might also have played a role.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- If not, he could use British actions in Greece to justify similar actions in countries in his own sphere of influence.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Despite the severe defeat, ELAS continued to exist, and the KKE had an opportunity to reconsider its strategy.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The hunting of "collaborators" was extended to people who were supporting the Greek government.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- After the ceasefire, ELAS under the leadership of Siantos left Athens, taking thousands of captives.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacian_language">Dacian language</a>
- There is thus considerable support for the thesis that Dacian developed in the Carpathian region during the third millennium BC, although its evolutionary pathways remains uncertain.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some may derive from other little-known ancient languages at some time spoken in Dacia or Moesia: for example, the Iranian Sarmatian, or the Turkic Pannonian Avar, Bulgar or Cuman languages,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> or, conceivably, some unknown pre-Indo-European language(s) of the Carpathians or Balkans.

- Dacian was probably one of the major languages of south-eastern Europe, spoken in the area between modern-day eastern Hungary to the Black Sea shore.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Although Strabo appears to portray these campaigns as short-term raids for plunder and to punish his enemies, several Romanian scholars have argued, on the basis of controversial interpretation of archaeological data, that they resulted in longer-term Dacian occupation and settlement of large territories beyond the dava zone.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- 60 – 44 BC – and Ptolemy's location of two -dava placenames on the lower Vistula river in Poland.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The settlement names ending in these suffixes are geographically grouped as follows:<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some of these are: Acmonia, Aizis, Amutria, Apulon, Arcina, Arcobadara, Arutela, Berzobis, Brucla, Diacum, Dierna, Dinogetia, Drobeta, Egeta, Genucla, Malva (Romula), Napoca, Oescus, Patruissa, Pinon, Potaissa, Ratiaria, Sarmizegetusa, Tapae, Tibiscum, Tirista, Tsierna, Tyrida, Zaldapa, Zeugma and Zurobara.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Phonologically Dacian is a conservative Indo-European (IE) language.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- From the remaining fragments, the sound changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Dacian can be grouped as follows:<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In other words, the isogloss is worthless as a tool to determine the genetic descent of IE languages.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, even if such reconstructions are accepted as valid, an insufficient quantity of words have been reconstructed in each language to establish that they were unrelated.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Venetic and Phrygian are considered centum languages, and this may mean that Georgiev, like many other paleolinguists, viewed Illyrian as probably being a centum language<sup>[citation needed]</sup> with Daco-Moesian admixture.
- About 300 words in Eastern Romance languages, Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, may derive from Dacian, and many of these show a satem-reflex.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- 500–1300), and finally to be imported into the Romanian language, when the latter became the predominant language in the region (which does not appear to have occurred before the 13th or 14th century<sup>[citation needed]</sup>).
- In contrast, Slavic has a far stronger claim to constitute the substratum of Romanian,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> because 10–15% of the Romanian lexicon, numerous grammatical features, and a majority of Romanian placenames, are of Slavic origin, or of pre-Slavic origin transmitted through Slavic forms: see Slavic influence on Romanian and Romanian place names).

- The first Roman conquest of part of Dacia did not extinguish the language, as Free Dacian tribes may have continued to speak Dacian in the area north-east of the Carpathians as late as the 6th or 7th century AD.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Another hypothesis (Marius) considers Albanian to be a Daco-Moesian dialect that split off from Dacian before 300 BC and that Dacian itself became extinct.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In this scenario, Albanian/Romanian cognates are either Daco-Moesian loanwords acquired by Albanian, or, more likely, Illyrian loanwords acquired by Romanian.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, Romanian substratum words shared with Albanian show a Romanian /a/ that corresponds to an Albanian /o/ when the source of both sounds is an original common /aː/ (mazăre / modhull &lt; <sup>[citation needed]</sup>maːdzula 'pea', raţă / rosë &lt; *raːtjaː 'duck'), indicating that when these words had the same common form in Pre-Romanian and Proto-Albanian, the transformation PAlb /aː/ &gt; PAlb /o/ had not yet begun.*
- The correlation between these two theories indicates that the hypothetical split between the pre-Roman Dacians, who were later Romanised, and Proto-Albanian happened before the Romans arrived in the Balkans.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaziranga_National_Park">Kaziranga National Park</a>
- The history of Kaziranga as a protected area can be traced back to 1904, when Mary Curzon, Baroness Curzon of Kedleston, the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, visited the area.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1916, it was redesignated the "Kaziranga Game Sanctuary" and remained so till 1938, when hunting was prohibited and visitors were permitted to enter the park.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Stracey, the forest conservationist, in order to rid the name of hunting connotations.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1954, the government of Assam passed the Assam (Rhinoceros) Bill, which imposed heavy penalties for rhinoceros poaching.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Encroachment by people along the periphery has also led to a diminished forest cover and a loss of habitat.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This match was not acceptable to their families, and the couple disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again, and the forest was named after them.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Among the Karbis, Kajir is a common name for a girl child,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and it was believed that a woman named Kajir once ruled over the area.
- Kaziranga is located between latitudes 26°30' N and 26°45' N, and longitudes 93°08' E to 93°36' E within two districts in the Indian state of Assam—the Kaliabor subdivision of Nagaon district and the Bokakhat subdivision of Golaghat district.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Kaziranga has flat expanses of fertile, alluvial soil, formed by erosion and silt deposition by the River Brahmaputra.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The landscape consists of exposed sandbars, riverine flood-formed lakes known as, beels, (which make up 5% of the surface area),<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and elevated regions known as, chapories, which provide retreats and shelter for animals during floods.
- Kaziranga contains significant breeding populations of 35 mammalian species, of which 15 are threatened as per the IUCN Red List.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, Indian gray mongoose, small Indian mongooses, large Indian civet, small Indian civets, Bengal fox, golden jackal, sloth bear, Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolins, hog badger, Chinese ferret badgers, and particoloured flying squirrel.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Prominent among them are the Assamese macaque, capped and golden langur, as well as the only ape found in India, the hoolock gibbon.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Kaziranga's rivers are also home to the endangered Ganges dolphin.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees—dominant species including kumbhi, Indian gooseberry, the cotton tree (in savanna woodlands), and elephant apple (in inundated grasslands).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The invasive water hyacinth is very common, often choking the water bodies, but it is cleared during destructive floods.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- To escape the water-logged areas, many animals migrate to elevated regions outside the park boundaries where they are susceptible to hunting, hit by speeding vehicles, or subject to reprisals by villagers for damaging their crops.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- To mitigate the losses, the authorities have increased patrols, purchased additional speedboats for patrol, and created artificial highlands for shelter.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- To prevent the spread of diseases and to maintain the genetic distinctness of the wild species, systematic steps such as immunization of livestock in surrounding villages and fencing of sensitive areas of the park, which are susceptible to encroachment by local cattle, are undertaken periodically.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- To control the growth and irradiation of invasive species, research on biological methods for controlling weeds, manual uprooting and weeding before seed settling are carried out at regular intervals.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Visitors are allowed to take their own vehicles when accompanied by guides.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- These requirements were declared unconstitutional by supreme court ruling in a 2011.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Until 2008, the person had to be unmarried.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The TSG applies only to German citizens; there are exceptions only for non-German citizens with very specific legal status, such as stateless people living legally in Germany, or in case the foreign state has no equivalent law, which would be in accordance with German constitution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Also, people with only a name change do not have to divulge their legal gender to employers.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Grodzka is reportedly the only transsexual person with ministerial responsibilities in the world since 10 November 2011.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- People who thought that they had existing valid marriages, turned out not to, and the previous unofficial changing of birth certificates was stopped.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Even so, transsexual people were able to change their names freely, to have their passports and driving licences altered, to have their National Insurance details changed, and so forth,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made it illegal to discriminate on the ground of anatomical sex in employment, education and the provision of housing, goods, facilities and services.
- United Kingdom (1986), it was decided that the UK was not violating any human rights, but that they should keep the situation under review.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_fiction">Magic in fiction</a>
- Historically, many writers who have written about fictional magicians, and the readers of such works, have believed that such magic is possible.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In most fantasy works, writers tend to depict magic as an innate talent, equivalent to perfect pitch, and there is wide variation on how spontaneously a person or other being with such a talent can use it.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Talents that occur spontaneously usually need training in order to control their abilities.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Those who use such spontaneously generated powers are usually not called magicians or similar terms, those being reserved usually for those who have to learn to wield magic.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some works treat magic as a force that is acquired through studying books and tomes.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Works which feature this concept usually include a school where magic is taught as a main setting.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Magic may also be gained by having it bestowed upon one by another,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> either through a pact with a devil or with other spirits, as is common in folklore.
- In some cases, the demon may only provide the means for the would-be wizard to learn magic,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> or the pact may be for the devil to do the magic on the wizard's behalf, forcing the wizard to compel it to act.
- In some cases, the demon may only provide the means for the would-be wizard to learn magic, or the pact may be for the devil to do the magic on the wizard's behalf, forcing the wizard to compel it to act.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Sword and sorcery heroes are depicted as fighting against this type of wizard, along with crazed cults where gods or demons give power to their followers.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Such items may be created by magicians or powerful beings, often in the distant past, but aren't possible to create at the present time of the story.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Other fictional magical objects may have no explained past.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Italian fairy tales put wands into the hands of the powerful fairies by the late Middle Ages and the concept was transmitted to modern fantasy.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In some works, types of magic are divided by color.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- As in folkloric and occult tradition, the white and black magic dichotomy may also exist in these works.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some works feature magic that is performed through using words to cast spells.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Many works use this method without offering an explanation for it while others do, with the explanation for it differing from one work to another.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some works feature magic that is tied to a certain area, such as an enchanted forest or an ancient battlefield.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Such places are usually the homes of powerful magical beings.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In these works, magic can only be accessed and performed in the area in question and runs out when all of the magic in the area is used up.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Various techniques are used by fantasy writers to limit the amount of magic in a story, such as limiting the amount of spells a character has, restricting a character's magic through the use of an object, limiting magic to the use of certain materials and making the materials hard to find, restricting the amount of magic a character can use due to the consequences of using it, and limiting the amount of magic a character has.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_theology">Seventh-day Adventist theology</a>
- According to Ed Christian, former JATS editor, "few if any ATS members believe in verbal inerrancy".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was particularly true in the early days of the movement, when it was assumed that most people the church witnessed to were already Christian to begin with, and that they already understood the gospel.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Sabbath is also a time for Adventists to spend with other people and with God.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It should be noted, however, that although Seventh-day Adventists do not believe that they are saved by keeping Saturday as the Sabbath, they attach considerably greater significance to Saturday-Sabbath keeping than other denominations attach to worship on Sunday.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Sabbath commandment is seen as an act of faith in God's ideal for the believer, although its significance may not be seen by non-believers.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- They believe that the Sabbath is a whole day dedicated for worship and fellowship with believers, laying aside non-religious projects and labor.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This change became more universally accepted with the establishment of Roman emperor Constantine's Sunday law of 321 AD and the decree at the Council of Laodicea that in canon 29 declared that Christians should avoid work on Sunday.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- God has permitted Lucifer's rebellion to continue on Earth in order to demonstrate to angels and beings on other worlds that his Law is righteous and necessary, and that the breaking of the 10 commandments leads to moral catastrophe.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- White, particularly chapter 29, The Origin of Evil is also sometimes referenced.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Adventists hold that Christ ministered his blood in the first section of the sanctuary (the holy place) until October 1844; after that time he entered the second section of the sanctuary (the Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies) in fulfillment of the Day of Atonement.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Adventists therefore believe that Christ's work of atonement encompasses both his death on the Cross and his ministration in the heavenly sanctuary.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Adventists believe that the unrighteous, or wicked, will be raised after the millennium.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The time of trouble will be ended by the glorious appearing of Christ, which will also mark the commencement of the millennium.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- A further difference is that the millennial reign of Christ will take place in heaven, not on earth, and will involve all of the redeemed people of God, not just national Israel.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Seventh-day Adventism interprets the book of Revelation using the historicist method, but also holds that some of the events it predicts are still future (see: interpretations of the Book of Revelation).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The theological term for this teaching is Annihilationism.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Adventist education hence strives to be holistic in nature, involving not just the mind but all aspects of a person.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Whatever the prominence assigned to her writings for doctrinal authority, Adventists are agreed that the Bible takes precedence as the final authority.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky’s side.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee’s first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Perhaps the biggest impact of the "Ernie and Bernie" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- O’Neill—an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter<sup>[citation needed]</sup>—took over a program depleted in talent.
- This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2012.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Solipsism</a>
- Based on a philosophy of subjective idealism, metaphysical solipsists maintain that the self is the only existing reality and that all other reality, including the external world and other persons, are representations of that self, and have no independent existence.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Epistemological solipsists claim that realism requires the question: assuming that there is a universe independent of an agent's mind and knowable only through the agent's senses, how is the existence of this independent universe to be scientifically studied?<sup>[citation needed]</sup> If a person sets up a camera to photograph the moon when he is not looking at it, then at best he determines that there is an image of the moon in the camera when he eventually looks at it.
- To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Methodological solipsism is an agnostic variant of solipsism<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- It still entertains the points that any induction is fallible and that we may be brains in vats<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- Descartes' cartesian skepticism).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise<sup>[citation needed]</sup> brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist.
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- The experience of a given person is necessarily private to that person.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since Descartes elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the primary goal of epistemology, whilst also elevating epistemology to "first philosophy".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Solipsism is often introduced in the context of relating it to pathological psychological conditions.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The lack of ability to prove the existence of other minds does not, in itself, cause the psychiatric condition of detachment from reality.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that methodology assumes that humans have no access to omniscience and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via scientific and logical conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The solipsist, however, would be more likely to put one's self (or merely their own mind) in the center, as the only item of reality, with all other beings (and perhaps even their own body) in reality illusions.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Taoism<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and several interpretations of Buddhism, especially Zen, teach that the distinction between self and universe is arbitrary, merely a habit of perception and an artifact of language.
- After the development of distinct schools of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- On the other hand, solipsism posits the non-existence of the external void right at the beginning, and says that no further inquiry is possible.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_Russian_Federation">Economic history of the Russian Federation</a>
- However, experts noted that control of inflation was aided substantially by the failure to pay wages to workers in state enterprises, a policy that kept prices low by depressing demand.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The most drastic example of such fluctuation was the Black Tuesday (1994) 27% reduction in the ruble's value.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In May 1996, a "crawling band" exchange rate was introduced to allow the ruble to depreciate gradually through the end of 1996, beginning between 5,000 and 5,600 per US $1 and ending between 5,500 and 6,100.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This meant that Russian citizens and foreigners would be able to convert rubles to other currencies for trade transactions.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Shortly thereafter, the government provided 181 billion rubles (about US$1.1 billion) in credits to enterprises that were still holding debt.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Gaidar's successor was Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former head of the State Natural Gas Company (Gazprom), who was considered less favorable to neoliberal reform.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Budget deficits were to be brought under control by limiting wage increases for state enterprises, by establishing quarterly budget deficit targets, and by providing a more efficient social safety net for the unemployed and pensioners.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Based on positive early results from this policy, the IMF extended the first payment of US$1.5 billion to Russia from a special Systemic Transformation Facility (STF) the following July.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- State enterprise arrears, for example, had built up in 1993 to about 15 trillion rubles (about US$13 billion, according to the mid-1993 exchange rate).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- But stabilization was undermined by the Central Bank, which issued credits to enterprises at subsidized rates, and by strong pressure from industrial and agricultural lobbies seeking additional credits.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Although experts presented a number of theories to explain the drop, including the existence of a conspiracy, the loosening of credit and monetary controls clearly was a significant cause of declining confidence in the Russian economy and its currency.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Furthermore, the parliament passed restrictions on the use of monetary policy to finance the state debt, and the Ministry of Finance began to issue government bonds at market rates to finance the deficits.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In this budget proposal, the Chernomyrdin government sent a signal that it no longer would tolerate soft credits and loose budget constraints, and that stabilization must be a top government priority.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Therefore, political conditions caused both Duma deputies and the president to make promises to increase spending.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In November 1995, Yeltsin was forced to replace her with Sergey Dubinin, a Chernomyrdin protégé who continued the tight-money policy that Paramonova had established.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Official Russian economic statistics indicate that from 1990 to the end of 1995, Russian GDP declined by roughly 50%, far greater than the decline that the United States experienced during the Great Depression.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- The town was of great importance in securing lines of communication between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It was fairly lightly inhabited before the attack, with about 400 Serb civilians residing in the area and was held by units of the SVK's 15th Lika Corps.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The attack involved around 2,500 troops drawn from the Croatian Army's Gospić Operational Zone, including the 9th Guards Brigade, 111th Brigade, Gospić Home Guard Battalion, Lovinac Home Guard Battalion and Special Police Units of the Croatian Ministry of the Interior (MUP).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- The two sides exchanged heavy artillery fire during 12–13 September, with the UN recording over 6,000 detonations in the Gospić-Medak area.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The UN forces, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel James Calvin, were instructed to interpose themselves between the Serb and Croatian forces.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Canadians were among the best trained troops at UNPROFOR's disposal, making them a natural choice for this dangerous task.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- As night fell the Croatians attempted several flanking manoeuvres but the Canadians responded with fire against the Croatian infantry.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Croatian commander, Rahim Ademi, upon realizing that his forces could not complete their objectives, met with the Canadian commander and agreed to a ceasefire where his troops would withdraw by noon the next day.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The withdrawal was finally verified as having been completed by 18:00 on 17 September, bringing the offensive to an end.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was denied by Calvin, and decorated Canadian Army veterans who served at Medak.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- For their part, the Croatian authorities, both civil and military, during the aftermath of the skirmish with the UN forces and in the years that followed, have never admitted that any serious battle with the UNPROFOR forces in the Medak area ever occurred and claim that the Canadian forces' version of events is politically motivated.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- But, fed by the release of an early mix of "Born to Run" to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album's release.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Springsteen has also referred to a maturation in his lyrics, calling Born to Run "the album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedom—it was the dividing line." In addition, Springsteen spent more time in the studio refining songs than he had on the previous two albums.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During this time Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard "sounds in [his] head" that he could not explain to the others in the studio.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Originally, he had planned to begin and end the album with alternative versions of "Thunder Road".)<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- These copies, known as the "script cover," are very rare and considered to be the "holy grail" for Springsteen collectors.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Now fearing the hype might backfire, Columbia suspended all press interviews with Springsteen.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- But the album had established a solid national fan base for Springsteen which he would build on with each subsequent release.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The following week it made an impressive increase entering the top 10 at #8, then spent two weeks at #4, and finally, during the weeks of October 11 and October 18, Born to Run reached its peak position of #3.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Songs from Born to Run were performed live as early as mid-1974, and by 1975, all had made their way into Springsteen's shows and (with the rare exception of "Meeting Across the River") continued to be a regular staple of his concerts on subsequent tours through 2009.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Springsteen and the E Street Band performed Born to Run in its entirety and in order for the first time at a benefit performance at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey, on May 7, 2008.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It was again performed during their September 20, 2009, show at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, as well as several other shows on the fall 2009 leg of the Working on a Dream Tour.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During the 2013 spring-summer run of his Wrecking Ball Tour, Springsteen again began to perform the album in its entirety although a few times its performance was not included in the actual set lists and it was performed as either a surprise or request.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During the Born to Run tours, Springsteen and Clemons would occasionally duplicate the pose onstage for several seconds after a song while the stage lights were dim.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- By the Shakespearean period, these ancient texts still maintained a currency demonstrated by King Lear based on the ancient tale of Leir of Britain which names Corineus the eponymous founder of the Cornish nation; he traditionally wrestled the giant Goemagot into the sea at Plymouth Hoe and claimed the land beyond for his people; the probable origin of the tale of Jack the Giant Killer.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Writing in the Cornish dialect has generally been overshadowed by the Cornish language<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- However, from the 19th century onwards poems and short stories have been published, often with a typically Cornish humour<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- Then there are literary works in standard English including conversations between dialect speakers.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the Cornish language.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Cornish and Breton languages were mutually intelligible until Tudor times<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and there were many Bretons living in Cornwall before the Prayer Book Rebellion.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebetiko">Rebetiko</a>
- Manos Hatzidakis summarized the key elements in three words with a wide presence in the vocabulary of modern Greek meraki, kefi, and kaimos (μεράκι, κέφι, καημός: love, joy, and sorrow).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Then, when the original form was almost forgotten, and its original protagonists either dead, or in some cases almost consigned to oblivion, it became, from the 1960s onwards, a revived musical form of wide popularity, especially among younger people of the time.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This process extended over more than a decade.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Vassilis Tsitsanis now became a leading personality in rebetiko music.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He was both a brilliant bouzouki player and a prolific composer, with hundreds of songs to his credit.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- After the war he continued to develop his style in new directions, and under his wing, singers such as Sotiria Bellou, Stella Haskil, Marika Ninou and Prodromos Tsaousakis made their appearance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Chiotis was already a seemingly fully-fledged virtuoso on the traditional 3-course instrument by his teens, but the guitar-based tuning of his new instrument, in combination with his playful delight in extreme virtuosity, led to new concepts of bouzouki playing which came to define the style used in laïki mousiki and other forms of bouzouki music which could no longer really be called rebetiko in any sense.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Kazantzidis went on to become a star of the emerging laiki music.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- From 1960 onwards prominent Greek composers such as Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hatzidakis employed bouzouki virtuosi such as Manolis Chiotis, Giorgos Zambetas, and Thanassis Polyhandriotis in their recordings.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was perhaps because rebetiko lyrics, although seldom directly political, were easily construed as subversive by the nature of their subject matter and their association in popular memory with previous periods of conflict.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The genre is a subject of growing international research, and its popularity outside Greece is now well-established.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- From the latter years of the second decade of the century there exist a number of recordings that can be considered as rebetiko, a few years before such songs began to appear on recordings in Greece.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Even songs originally recorded with typical bouzouki-baglamas-guitar accompaniment could appear in Anatolian garments.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Prominent among them were Ioannis Papaioannou, Manolis Chiotis, Vassilis Tsitsanis, Iordanis Tsomidis, Roza Eskenazi, Stratos Pagioumdzis, Stavros Tzouanakos, and Giannis Tatasopoulos, of whom the latter three died in the United States.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol">Estradiol</a>
- One principle pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy derivative, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and then to Δ4-androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Action of aromatase on Δ4-androstenedione generates estrone, and action of a dehydrogenase on this gives the title compound, 17β-estradiol.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Fat structure and skin composition are modified by estradiol.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It affects the production of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In addition, several benign gynecologic conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, and uterine bleeding.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This is often prescribed in combination with clomifene.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Soybeans are another bean that contains chemicals that act similarly to estrogen in the human body and also cause such interactions.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- As the name implies, estradiol, sometimes abbreviated as E2, has two hydroxyl groups in its molecular structure; its relatives estrone (E1) and estriol (E3) have one and three, respectively, and estetrol (E4) has four.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Based on its unique chemical structure, estradiol is about 10 times as potent as estrone and about 80 times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic effect.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During the reproductive years of the human female, its serum levels are somewhat higher than that of estrone, except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, estrone predominates (both based on serum levels).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus">Simon Magus</a>
- Surviving traditions about Simon appear in orthodox texts, such as those of Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius, where he is often regarded as the source of all heresies<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- According to the early church heresiologists, Simon is also supposed to have written several lost treatises, two of which bear the titles The Four Quarters of the World and The Sermons of the Refuter.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In apocryphal works including the Acts of Peter, Pseudo-Clementines, and the Epistle of the Apostles, Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The different sources for information on Simon contain quite different pictures of him, so much so that it has been questioned whether they all refer to the same person.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some scholars have considered the two to be identical, although this is not generally accepted, as the Simon of Josephus is a Jew rather than a Samaritan.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Justin and Irenaeus are the first to recount the myth of Simon and Helen, which became the center of Simonian doctrine.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Special to the Simonian tale is the identification of Simon himself with the Supreme, and of his consort Helena with the female principle.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some believe that Hippolytus' account is of a later, more developed form of Simonianism, and that the original doctrines of the group were simpler, close to the account given by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus (this account however is also included in Hippolytus' work).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- But he also adds, "if any one, on seeing the images either of Simon or Helen, shall call them by those names, he is cast out, as showing ignorance of the mysteries."<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Law, according to him, was not of God, but of "the sinister power." The same was the case with the prophets, and it was death to believe in the Old Testament.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Cyril of Jerusalem (346 AD) in the sixth of his Catechetical Lectures prefaces his history of the Manichaeans by a brief account of earlier heresies: Simon Magus, he says, had given out that he was going to be translated to heaven, and was actually careening through the air in a chariot drawn by demons when Peter and Paul knelt down and prayed, and their prayers brought him to earth a mangled corpse.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- They are of uncertain date and authorship, and seem to have been worked over by several hands in the interest of diverse forms of belief.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He did indeed preach righteousness and judgment to come.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- A description is given of how he made a familiar spirit for himself by conjuring the soul out of a boy and keeping his image in his bedroom, and many instances of his feats of magic are given.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- While the Church of England originally held a position of privilege in early colonial Australia, a legal framework guaranteeing religious equality began to evolve within a few short decades.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Christian churches, in particular, have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- While less than a quarter of Christians attend church weekly, around a quarter of all school students attend church-affiliated schools<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and the Christian festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays.
- The Roman Catholic Church is by far the largest non-government provider of health and education services in Australia<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and faith-based aid organisations such as the St Vincent De Paul Society and the Salvation Army receive widespread community support.

- Other groups were also represented, for example among the Tolpuddle Martyrs, were a number of Methodists.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Islam was not a significant minority in this period.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Further waves of migration and the gradual repeal of the White Australia Policy helped to reshape the profile of Australia's religious affiliations over subsequent decades.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The impact of migration from Europe in the aftermath of World War II led to increases in affiliates of the Orthodox churches, the establishment of Reformed bodies, growth in the number of Catholics (largely from Italian migration) and Jews (Holocaust survivors) and the creation of ethnic parishes among many other denominations.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- As has been the trend throughout the world since the 11 September attacks, there has been an increasingly strained relationship between the adherents of Islam and the wider community.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, the influence of the identity politics as a whole is not to be discounted in this respects; reflected in the conflicting and ambiguous interpretation of the 2005 race riots in Cronulla near Sydney.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, European Muslims from Albania and Bosnia did arrive in numbers especially in the 1920s and 1930s.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Although the first definite cases of Buddhist settlement in Australia were in 1848, there has been speculation from some anthropologists that there may have been contact some hundreds of years earlier.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- After World War I, Sikhs in Australia were given rights far greater than other Asians<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and made use of them by emigrating to Australia and working as labourers.

- This small contribution can be worthwhile over the aircraft's lifetime, provided the benefit offsets the cost of installing and maintaining the winglets.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Light," "Heavy," etc.) because the vortex strength grows with the aircraft lift coefficient, and thus, the associated turbulence is greatest at low speed and high weight.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The fence/winglet drives the area where the vortex forms upward away from the wing surface, since the center of the resulting vortex is now at the tip of the winglet.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Large winglets such as those seen on Boeing 737 aircraft equipped with blended winglets are most useful during short-distance flights, where increased climb performance offsets increased drag.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Learjet's application of winglets to production aircraft continued with newer models including the Learjet 55, 31, 60, 45, and Learjet 40.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The airplane gained supplemental type certification in 2003, and the majority of 737s delivered today are equipped with the devices.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- These include the rule that the Dutch monarch cannot dissolve the House of Representatives more than once because of a conflict over a single political issue<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and that the Senate shall never block legislation for mere party politics, so that coalition governments (all Dutch governments since the 19th century) do not need a majority in the Senate.
- These include the rule that the Dutch monarch cannot dissolve the House of Representatives more than once because of a conflict over a single political issue and that the Senate shall never block legislation for mere party politics,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> so that coalition governments (all Dutch governments since the 19th century) do not need a majority in the Senate.
- Indeed, that force is much larger than with written constitutional rules;<sup>[citation needed]</sup> any breach of the unwritten rules would cause an immediate constitutional crisis.
- Dutch courts tend to give precedence to the practicality of police investigation, so this article has had little protective value.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In practice the Dutch police taps any telephone communication at will, irrespective of authorisation and with full cooperation of the telephone companies.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In fact the Dutch penal code contains loopholes making it possible to delay trials indefinitely.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This means that the King cannot act in a public capacity without ministerial approval: externally the governmental policy is always represented by the responsible minister who, should he feel that the King's personal influence in it threatens to become too predominant, has to resign if he cannot prevent it; what happens internally between King and ministers is the Crown Secret, never to be divulged.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- What little of it nevertheless has come to the public attention, shows that the common conception that the kingship since the reign of William III of the Netherlands has in fact been almost fully ceremonial, is not supported by the facts.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Often it is assumed that there is a "derived ministerial responsibility" for all members of the Royal House.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Like the King the Dutch Prime Minister is also not the Head of Government<sup>[citation needed]</sup> — the Netherlands has none — but he is normally treated that way abroad.
- Though existing since 1823, this council has only been mentioned since the revision of 1983; its constitutional powers as such are almost nil.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The individual ministers do not have a (general) executive power, other than that which is attributed to them by special law.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannadice_Park">Tannadice Park</a>
- The name of the ground was changed to Tannadice when Dundee Hibernian took over the lease in 1909.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Hibs committee made an offer to the landlords which exceeded what Wanderers were paying; as a result, the established tenants were informed that their lease would not be renewed for the coming season.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The original capacity of Tannadice Park was around 10,000, the terracings were specially extended and additional temporary seating erected for a Qualifying Cup-tie against Forfar Athletic in 1913; all of this was necessary to allow a record crowd to be accommodated, and the reported attendance was 15,000.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was opened in 1971 and overlooked the pitch, something that is now a common sight in football grounds across the country.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Unfortunately the first time the under-soil heating was called into action was when a fairly heavy snowfall started during the UEFA Cup 3rd round first leg tie against Neuchâtel Xamax on 27 November 1985 and the system failed.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 2009, the traditional flood lights were removed and replaced with a brighter roof mounted lighting system, and in 2010 the original wooden seats in the Jerry Kerr stand were removed and replaced with tangerine plastic seating.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- With season ticket holders now accommodated in the more modern parts of the stadium, the Shed can be allocated to either home or away supporters as demand dictates.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It is allocated to home supporters.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Cup ties tended to attract higher attendances in this era, and after the terraces were specially extended to accommodate the expected large crowd, 15,000 watched a Scottish Qualifying Cup tie against Forfar Athletic on 1 November 1913.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Then a much larger than anticipated crowd of 23,517 packed in to watch an important late season Tayside derby against St Johnstone on 17 April 1926, with both clubs fighting relegation.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Since then, in common with many other grounds, safety legislation and conversion to all-seating has drastically reduced Tannadice's capacity, with the modern stadium holding little over half that number.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Hnatiuk joined the Christian Heritage Party in 2002 and has run as a candidate for the party in Nova Scotia in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 federal elections.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He came in fifth, losing to Scott Armstrong of the Conservative Party of Canada.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Because of a difference in understanding on the leader's mandate to innovate in membership qualifications, and a motion by the national board to ask that the leader put promotion of his vision on hold until a full board meeting could discuss the vision, Hnatiuk submitted his resignation as leader effective February 1, 2014, though choosing to continue as a party member.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- He served as candidate in the 2014 by-election in Macleod, Alberta.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Until early 2014, Reimer served as interim provincial president for Manitoba, and was appointed as interim national leader to succeed Hnatiuk until the fall 2014 national convention.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Numerous chapels offered "quick and quiet" marriages.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Among them was the 91st Ohio Infantry, which was organized at Camp Ironton on August 26, 1862.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The quality of the iron that had once made Ironton one of the leading producers of pig iron was no longer considered as desirable.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- All of the easily accessible iron had been mined by 1899, and the continued production costs began to outweigh the benefit.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The iron industry declined, affecting other industries as well.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The region has had difficulty creating an alternate economy.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It earned a record of 85 wins, 19 losses, 14 ties, including an undefeated season in 1922, a state championship in 1926, and dual victories in 1930 over National Football League (NFL) powerhouses the Chicago Bears and New York Giants.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- The amount of musical activity in Liverpool and Manchester caused record producers who had previously never ventured very far from London to start looking to the north.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- A recording studio, "Cavern Sound" opened in the basement of an adjoining building, run by Nigel Greenberg and Peter Hepworth.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Dutch group Focus were the last to play The Cavern, a few days before the club was shut down in May 1973.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was a difficult period of massive economic and political change in and around Liverpool and the club only survived until 1989, when it came under financial pressures and closed for 18 months.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In 1991, two friends—schoolteacher Bill Heckle and taxi driver Dave Jones—reopened The Cavern.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Spektrum">Oslo Spektrum</a>
- In 2004 Oslo Spektrum was awarded the Oslo City Council's award for outstanding architectural achievement.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In Greater Oslo both Vallhall Arena (capacity 13,000 for concerts/4,000 for sporting events) and Telenor Arena (capacity 25,000/15,000) provide larger venues.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This makes it easily accessible and minimizes traffic problems when crowds arrive at events and disperse afterwards, which has been an issue with other venues such as the more remotely located Telenor Arena.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Designed from the outset to be flexible and in line with international standards for sporting events and concerts, Oslo Spektrum can accommodate almost any type of entertainment show or sports event that can fit inside.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It has built-in ice making facilities, and while it is rarely used for ice hockey nowadays, it regularly hosts ice shows like Walt Disney's World on Ice.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It also hosts the Norwegian Handball Championships, for a period becoming Norway's largest handball arena.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Currently, Spektrum hosts a total of 100 events annually,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> with some 400.
- Currently, Spektrum hosts a total of 100 events annually, with some 400.000 visitors.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub">Fansub</a>
- Hard subs have traditionally been more popular than softsubs, due to a lack of player support and worries over plagiarism, but most fansub groups now release a softsub version of their releases.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Many of the early digital fansubs were made from regular tape subs.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However Hatcher states that copyright law in the United States—the frame of reference for most online discussions of fansub legality—construes translations as derivative, and fansubs infringe on the author's right to prepare derivative works<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and to reproduction by copying original source material.
- Past market reactions have shown that time might be better spent petitioning 4Kids for a bilingual release, and supporting the uncut release of former 4Kids licenses like One Piece, to show them there is a market for such titles.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- After fan demand showed there was a market for the title,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> uncut, unedited versions of the show, and Pioneer successfully release the Sailor Moon Movies in a subtitled VHS format in 1999, followed by dubbed versions and bilingual DVDs.
- The lack of buzz that surrounded these titles has been linked by fansub supporters<sup>[citation needed]</sup> to MFI's suppression of fan distribution.
- They argue that by cutting off this means of "free advertisement," MFI has alienated fans who would normally buy their products after they were licensed and kept the shows from being as widely exposed as they might otherwise be.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The end result, say fansub supporters,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> is a reduced interest from American anime companies and a loss of revenue for the studio.
- It took the series over 2 years to be licensed, which was normal for anime licenses around 2002.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Fansub opposers claim<sup>[citation needed]</sup> that Japanese licensors have reportedly grown discontent with fansubbers because the ease of access with which their works are obtained has begun to affect foreign licensees' willingness to license a series, as evidenced by the Western market's sharp drop in new acquisitions in 2005.
- They also suggest<sup>[citation needed]</sup> that anime fans in Japan have reportedly begun to turn to English fansubs which often appear days after a show's release, affecting sales in their home market.

- The home video version and cable reruns of this episode were reconstructed from a combination of this soundtrack, video still frames sourced from other episodes, and the closing and opening scenes from episodes #1218 and #1220 respectively.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The search for the preserved episodes of this series also uncovered several hundred episodes thought lost of another series, The Hollywood Squares.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This is why the last episode produced has #1245 when in actuality it was only the 1,225th episode produced.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Individuals of normal appearance were transformed into hideous creatures of the netherworld.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The original soundtrack cracked the top 20 of Billboard's national albums chart in 1969 and still ranks as one of the top-selling TV soundtracks ever.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The single peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (and number 3 on its Easy Listening chart) in summer 1969, when Dark Shadows was perhaps at the peak of its popularity.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- There have also been two board games, a few coloring books, two jigsaw puzzles, and a View-Master reel.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Episodes 211- 250 were made available, covering the introduction of Barnabas Collins.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Although it was a huge hit at introduction (watched by almost 1 in 4 households, according to official ratings during that time period), the onset of the Gulf War caused NBC to continually preempt or reschedule the episodes, resulting in declining ratings.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Army between 1902 and 1917.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Prussian army was also the first to adopt the frock coat, so officers would not soil their dress uniforms on campaign.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_Christianity">Mormonism and Christianity</a>
- The Mormonism that originated with Joseph Smith in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements of nineteenth-century Protestant Christianity.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In traditional Christianity, as expressed in the Athanasian Creed, God is conceived both as a unity and a Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are described as three persons of one uncreated divine being, equally infinite, eternal, and unchangeable.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Prophet has been compared to the Pope in Catholicism because both, within their respective faiths, are regarded as the leading authority.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Thus, Mormons believe that non-Mormon clergy have no heavenly authority and that sacraments performed by clergy of other faiths are of no effect in the eyes of God.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, the Community of Christ is engaged in ongoing informal discussions concerning this issue.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Episcopal Church (USA), part of the 80-million-member Anglican Communion, also does not recognize Mormon baptisms, though it recognizes Christian baptisms that are Trinitarian in nature.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, Daniel Tuttle, the Episcopal Church's first bishop of Utah, decided not to require re-baptism of LDS converts, and that practice continues today among most Episcopal clergy.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The lessons also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The release discouraged the use of the term "Mormon Church".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_law">Socialist law</a>
- While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of private property, how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the state or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Cases of development of common law into Socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This trend reached its zenith under Joseph Stalin with the ascendancy of Andrey Vyshinsky, when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in special tribunals.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to decriminalize lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called burlaw court (or, verbally, "court of comrades", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In some cases (for example in the case of urban residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of social welfare.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_slavery">Catholic Church and slavery</a>
- The depopulation of the Americas, and consequently the shortage of slaves,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> that came about through diseases allegedly brought over by the Europeans, and the harsh treatment of the native populations, inspired increasing debate during the 16th century over the morality of slavery.
- Nearly all Christian leaders before the late 17th century regarded slavery as consistent with Christian theology<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- Instead, they argue that the Church has always distinguished between just servitude which is deemed acceptable and unjust servitude which is considered wrong.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Like secular legal systems, the Church has at different times distinguished between various forms and elements of "slavery", often in a highly theoretical way that has been unclear in its practical application.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Christianity recognised marriage of sorts among slaves, freeing slaves was regarded as an act of charity, and when slaves were buried in Christian cemeteries, the grave seldom included any indication that the person buried had been a slave<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- The theoretical approach of the church to contacts with less-developed peoples in Africa and the Americas carried over from conflicts with Muslims the principle that resistance to Christian conquest, and to conversion, was sufficient to make people, including whole populations, "enemies of Christ", who could be justly enslaved, and then held in slavery even after conversion.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Las Casas also supported the importation of African slaves as preferable to Amerindian forced labour, although he later changed his mind about this<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- The bishops determined that this prohibition did not apply to slavery in the US.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Although most authors argue that there has been a shift in Church teaching over the last two millennia from acceptance and toleration of slavery to opposition, some Catholic writers reject this claim, insisting that there has been no such change in the Magisterium.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- The policy was well received by the people and in 1393, cultivated land rose to 8,804,623 ching and 68 mou, something not achieved during any other Chinese dynasty.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- While the Ming army was initially very effective, it was later affected by lack of preparation, and was defeated by the Mongols in 1449 during the Tumu Crisis.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The military was under the control of a civilian official for large campaigns, instead of a military general.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- One of his generals, Chang Yuchun, carried out massacres in some places<sup>[citation needed]</sup> in Shandong and Hunan provinces to take revenge against people who resisted his army.
- Many argue that the Hongwu Emperor, because of his wish to concentrate absolute authority in his own hands, removed the only insurance against incompetent emperors.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Ray Huang argued that Grand-Secretaries, outwardly powerless, could exercise considerable positive influence from behind the throne.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Under the Ming dynasty, the law protected both slaves and free citizens.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- A book titled Tu Pien Hsin Shu,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> written during the Ming dynasty, gave a detailed description about the activities of merchants at that time.
- During his reign, living standards also greatly improved.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion">Ocean thermal energy conversion</a>
- OTEC has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave power<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- The alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed, thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costs.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water (see heat pipe).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- OTEC has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power, and in conjunction with electrolysis, could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumption.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Even at shallower depths, the cost of mooring may be prohibitive.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- With OTEC plants supplying water, the only cost is for extraction.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The Japanese investigated the possibility of extracting uranium and found developments in other technologies (especially materials sciences) were improving the prospects.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Beneficial factors that should be taken into account include OTEC's lack of waste products and fuel consumption, the area in which it is available,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> (often within 20° of the equator) the geopolitical effects of petroleum dependence, compatibility with alternate forms of ocean power such as wave energy, tidal energy and methane hydrates, and supplemental uses for the seawater.

- Virtual service desk: for organizations having multi-country locations – can be situated and accessed from anywhere in the world due to advances in network performance and telecommunications, reducing operational costs<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and improving usage of available resources
- The certification scheme differs between ITIL v2 and ITIL 2007/2011, and bridge examinations (now retired) allowed owners of v2 certificates to transfer to the new program.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- These rights were obtained from OGC, the British government institution and owner of the ITIL trademark.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Now, after signing a contract with EXIN, BCS/ISEB, Loyalist Certification Services [1],PeopleCert Group and other certification bodies, APM Group has accredited them as official examination bodies, to offer ITIL exams and accredit ITIL training providers.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some researchers group ITIL with lean, Six Sigma and Agile software development operations management.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some vendors have also included the term Lean when discussing ITIL implementations, for example "Lean-ITIL".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The initial consequences of an ITIL initiative tend to add cost with benefits promised as a future deliverable.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Due to a new European Union law, gas stations are being required to offer a minimum rate of the new mixture of "Super" 95 RON with up to 10% Ethanol branded as "Super E10".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Producers are discontinuing "Super E5" 95 RON with &lt;5% Ethanol<sup>[citation needed]</sup> so cars that are unable to use E10 must use 98 RON gasoline automotive fuel instead.
- Shell V-Power is a 97 RON (labelled as 95 due to the legalities of only using 95 or 98 labelling), some independent tests have shown that one year after introduction it was downgraded to 95 RON,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> whereas in neighboring Germany Shell V-Power consists of the regular 100 RON fuel.

- The intermissions are usually given over to contests involving randomly selected audience members.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- More common in modern times, especially in major games, is to reserve the entire halftime period for a short concert by a major recording artist.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Until sometime in the early 1980s, these shows were typically included as part of the broadcast if the game was televised; since that time, it has become traditional for TV networks to devote the halftime to a roundup of other games' scores.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- High-profile acts are generally chosen for their broad appeal, due to the games' large audiences, and choices that deviate from that tend to be poorly received: for instance, in the 100th Grey Cup halftime show, balladeer Gordon Lightfoot received overwhelming approval, while teen-pop singer Justin Bieber was booed throughout his performance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Since it was broadcast live, the exposure was seen by millions when it happened.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- A study in a large comparative series of patients showed an 89% reduction in mortality over the five years following surgery, compared to a non-surgically treated group of patients.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, the first months following the surgery can be very difficult, an issue not often mentioned by physicians suggesting the surgery.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Even if physical activity is increased patients may still harbor long term psychological effects due to excess skin and fat.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- These extra surgeries have their own inherent risks but are even more dangerous when coupled with the typical nutritional deficiences that accompany convalescing gastric bypass patients.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_marketing">Green marketing</a>
- Environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needs.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- One of green marketing's challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes "green," according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- However, despite the growth in the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares, to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gases.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- That is, whether the Masoretic text which forms the basis of most modern English translations of the Old Testament, or translations which pre-date the masoretic text, such as the Septuagint, Syriac Peshitta, and Samaritan Pentateuch are more accurate.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Some of the latter have formed sects that have emphasized pacificism as a central tenet of their faith.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The earliest objections to incarnation come from Celsus and Porphyry.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- During Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, important Christian theologians advocated religious persecution to varying degrees.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Individuals might ignore and escape secular laws, but they could not do the same with divine laws, if Justinian declared his novels to be such.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It was in these fake capitularies where Benedictus utilized Justinian's interpretation as a justification for ecclesiastical supremacy over mundane institutions, thereby demanding<sup>[citation needed]</sup> burning at the stake for carnal sins in the name of Charlemagne himself.
- According to Benedictus, this was why all mundane institutions had to be subjected to ecclesiastical power in order to prevent moral as well as religious laxity causing divine wrath.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- In their literature, the principle of God's true nature as sexless is emphasized as in the Vishnu sahasranama.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Thus, the first few names, of Vishnu sahasranama, in particular, do not describe features of Vishnu in detail and hence are not anthropomorphic.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often the same people who are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It can also happen that some unidentified gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and lose track of where the class is in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Advocates of gifted education contend that gifted and/or talented youth are either motivationally, perceptually or intellectually prepared for a challenge not offered in the standard curriculum, so that it is appropriate to pace their lessons more aggressively by encouraging them to participate in honors courses, Advanced Placement courses, International Baccalaureate courses, and other sources of educational enrichment and acceleration.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The families of gifted and/or disabled students are often dissatisfied with the education system, which, while it may suit the majority of students, often fails to provide for those with special needs.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- The Kuomintang government also moved the entire gold reserve from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> and used this reserve to back the newly issued New Taiwan dollar to stabilize the new currency and put a stop to hyperinflation.
- That incident might also gave president Chen the ability of declaring martial emergency, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> from voting.
- Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the Pan-Green Coalition camp favoring the purchase, and the Pan-Blue Coalition opposing it.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Several years later, Stanshall was to provide the voiceover on Mike Oldfield's first instrumental album, Tubular Bells, which echoed the style of "The Intro and the Outro".<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- True to the dada spirit, Stanshall performed a mock striptease and Roger Ruskin Spear, with a platoon of robots (including one that sang "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" while actually blowing bubbles), did whatever he did without regard for what the rest of the band was doing.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- More recently, the last ever TV appearance by the original band, performing "Noises for the Leg" in December 1969 on the BBC, has surfaced.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Other types used to Sweden included, Lockheed Lodestars, Consolidated Liberators, and the sole Curtiss CW-20 (C-46 prototype) which BOAC had purchased; these types had more payload, and some had the range to avoid the enemy-controlled Skaggerak direct route.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was the first purchase of aircraft direct from the Douglas Aircraft Company in BOAC's history.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In the 1950s turbine powered airliners were developing rapidly, and the Comet and the seriously delayed Bristol Britannia were soon rendered obsolescent by the flight of the swept-wing Boeing 367–80 (707 prototype) in 1954.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Hajjaj sent Muhammad Bin Qasim for a revenge expedition against the Sindh kingdom in 711 A.D.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- An actual push into the region had been out of favor as an Arab policy since the time of the Rashidun Caliph Umar bin Khattab, who upon receipt of reports of it being an inhospitable and poor land, had stopped further expeditionary ventures into the region.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Muhammad bin Qasim's expedition was actually the third attempt, the first two having failed due to stiffer-than-expected opposition as well as heat, exhaustion.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Muhammad bin Qasim had a son named Amr bin Muhammad who later became governor of Sindh.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Moreover, between 324 and 330, Constantine built Constantinople as a new capital for the empire, and—with no apologies to the Roman community of Christians—relocated key Roman families and translated many Christian relics to the new churches he built from the ground up.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In reality, Constantine was baptized (nearing his death in May 337) by Eusebius of Nicomedia, an Arian bishop, unlike the pope.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Peter's Basilica (the "Constantinian Basilica").<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The gift of the Lateran probably occurred during the reign of Miltiades (311–14), predecessor to Sylvester I, who began using it as his residence.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax">Capital gains tax</a>
- There is no specific capital gains tax in Argentina; however, there is a 9% to 35% tax for fiscal residents on their world revenues, including capital gains.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This tax is widely avoided and not usually enforced,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> perhaps due to the difficulty in proving intent at the time of purchase.
- There is no separate tax on capital gains; rather, gains or gross receipt from sale of assets are absorbed into income tax base.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- If not, gains on sales of real estate and securities are absorbed into their personal income tax base and taxed at 13% (residents) and 30% (non-residents).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The changes were introduced, at least in part, because the UK government felt that private equity firms were making excessive profits by benefiting from overly generous taper relief on business assets<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.

- In the Royal Navy the task of disciplining the crew fell to the quartermasters and quartermaster's mates.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This was done using a rattan boatswain's cane on the boys and a rope's end on adult sailors.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Punishment could lawfully be inflicted on an officer's instruction or at his own will, or more formally on deck on the captain's or a court martial's orders.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Birching or use of the cat o' nine tails would have been typical in the latter case.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In a large crew he could delegate this to the boatswain's mates, who might alternate after each dozen lashes.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">Geometric distribution</a>
- This is the method of moments, which in this case happens to yield maximum likelihood estimates of p.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Golomb coding is the optimal prefix code for the geometric discrete distribution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-test">G-test</a>
- For very small samples the multinomial test for goodness of fit, and Fisher's exact test for contingency tables, or even Bayesian hypothesis selection are preferable to the G-test .<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- This approximation was developed by Karl Pearson because at the time it was unduly laborious to calculate log-likelihood ratios.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- In cases where  for some cell case the G-test is always better than the chi-squared test.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- It can also be shown<sup>[citation needed]</sup> that the inverse document frequency weighting commonly used for text retrieval is an approximation of G applicable when the row sum for the query is much smaller than the row sum for the remainder of the corpus.
- Similarly, the result of Bayesian inference applied to a choice of single multinomial distribution for all rows of the contingency table taken together versus the more general alternative of a separate multinomial per row produces results very similar to the G statistic.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- Rando reports that a group of artisans skilled in terrazzo work 'apparently' settled in Melbourne, and stonemasons from Lombardy arrived to build an Italian-style village at Hunters Hill near Sydney.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Although Italian settlers and Australians had fairly harmonious relations through most of the nineteenth century, "matters began to change once Italian workers and contadini (peasants) began arriving in greater numbers", as Rando observed.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- They seemed to detect a new determination to defend their economic interests and political rights and to counter the threats posed to their religion, language and traditions by a largely hostile social and political environment.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Within Australian society there was an opposition to Italian immigration that stemmed from the fact that Italian migrants were often seen as "Mediterranean scum", or as a "grave industrial and political danger", as reported by Lampugnani.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- So they were admitted in greater numbers than had previously seemed conceivable, as a 'third-best' type.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- The drains around the set are real so rain water can naturally flow from the streets.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The fourth side of the square plus further expansion to the exterior set was completed in 1987 with a further, final, expansion in 1993.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- The newer exterior sets including fish &amp; chip shop, video shop and beauty salon have some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make them look like they would in summer.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Throughout rebuilding filming would still take place, and so scaffolding was often seen on screen during the process, with some story lines written to accommodate the rebuilding, such as the Queen Vic fire.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

- In January 2015, the proposal was shelved, and all funding was to remain in place, as well as removing the requirement of CEP cadets having to pay an annual fee<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.
- Many are members of the academic or support staff at the school.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- 2006 Health and Safety/Child Protection legislation (and fallout from the Deepcut affair) mandated that cadets must be housed separately by both gender and age (under 18s and over 18s) and, as most MOD accommodation cannot cope with this, leading to a reduction in the number of courses offered to cadets.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
- Most schools, however, make CCF attendance voluntary, which tends to reduce numbers compared to compulsory contingents, but potentially results in a more uniformly dedicated membership that responds well to training as well as CCF activities many CCFs also offer the chance for RYA, National Indoor Climbing Award Schemes, BTEC and Duke of Edinburgh qualifications<sup>[citation needed]</sup> on top of their CCF training programmes.
