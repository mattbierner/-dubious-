#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_12_element">Group 12 element</a>
- Group 12 is also known as the volatile metals, although this can also more generally refer to any metal (which need not be in group 12) that has high volatility, such as polonium* or flerovium.
- Group 12 is also known as the volatile metals, although this can also more generally refer to any metal (which need not be in group 12) that has high volatility, such as polonium or flerovium.*
- Zinc is also referred to in nonscientific contexts as spelter.*
- Very little is known about copernicium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed except for its boiling point (tentative).*
- Above 210 °C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating.*
- For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 °C, 787.1 F) and boiling points (907 °C).*
- Cadmium is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds.*
- As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.*
- Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.*
- Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.*
- Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium.*
- It is also found in some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal.*
- For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.*
- All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band.*
- 2, two mercury(I) ions come together to form a metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species.*
- Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants.*
- This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride.*
- It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.*
- The color of the flame test of pure radium has never been observed; the crimson red color is an extrapolation from the flame test color of its compounds.*
- Both zinc and cadmium can also form octahedral complexes such as the aqua ions [M(H2O)6]2+ which are present in aqueous solutions of salts of these metals.*
- Nevertheless, the divalent state would be the main one in aqueous solution, and unhexquadium(II) should behave more similarly to lead than unhexquadium(IV) and unhexquadium(VI).*
- This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46 g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61 g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47 g·cm−3).*
- Theoretical interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotope 482Uhq (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons), would be at the center of a hypothetical second island of stability (the first being centered around 306Ubb, with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).*
- Zinc has been found being used in impure forms in ancient times as well as in alloys such as brass that have been found to be over 2000 years old.*
- Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of Fasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala and written about the year 1374.*
- The metal was also of use to alchemists.*
- The name of the metal was first documented in the 16th century, and is probably derived from the German zinke for the needle-like appearance of metallic crystals.*
- Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass paved the way for the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.*
- In 1817, cadmium was discovered in Germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate minerals (calamine) by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann.*
- It was named after the Latin cadmia for "calamine", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was in turn named after the Greek mythological character, Κάδμος Cadmus, the founder of Thebes.*
- Stromeyer eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide.*
- Stromeyer eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide.*
- In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures redefined the meter in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths).*
- At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.*
- Mercury has been found in Egyptian tombs which have been dated back to 1500 BC,* where mercury was used in cosmetics.
- It was also used by the ancient Chinese who believed it would improve and prolong health.*
- By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams (Medieval Latin amalgama, "alloy of mercury") with other metals.*
- The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.*
- It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal.*
- The heaviest known group 12 element, copernicium, was first created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) located in Darmstadt, Germany by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al.*
- It was then officially named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry after Nicolaus Copernicus on February 19, 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus' birth.*
- Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant.*
- As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper.*

- One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia.*
- Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust,* because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock.
- It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.*
- Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes.*

- In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan.*
- Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 10 million tonnes.*
- Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy.*
- Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide:* For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning.
- Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 °C (1,740 °F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor.*
- Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid:* After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.
- Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium.*
- Cadmium is isolated from the zinc produced from the flue dust by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution.*
- The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore in the deposits.*
- Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor.*
- Whereas most of the isotopes of copernicium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.*
- Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode.*
- These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal,* or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts.
- Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.*
- In the US, zinc is used predominantly for galvanizing (55%) and for brass, bronze and other alloys (37%).*
- Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion.*
- Zinc is also used as an anode material for batteries such as in zinc–carbon batteries* or zinc-air battery/fuel cells.

- The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%.*
- Cadmium electroplating, consuming 6% of the global production, can be found in the aircraft industry due to the ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components.*
- A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps,* while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations, and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.

- The entire expedition, 129 men including Franklin, was lost.*
- However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the expedition’s ships.*
- Franklin received his expedition command on 7 February 1845, and his official instructions on 5 May 1845.*
- Aside from Franklin, Crozier, and Lieutenant Graham Gore, the only other officers who were Arctic veterans were an assistant surgeon and the two ice-masters.*
- Letters written on board told how Franklin banned swearing and drunkenness.*
- After the three-pronged effort failed, British national concern and interest in the Arctic increased until "finding Franklin became nothing less than a crusade." Ballads such as "Lady Franklin's Lament", commemorating Lady Franklin's search for her lost husband, became popular.*

- Crozier was commanding the expedition, and the 105 survivors planned to start out the next day, heading south towards the Back River.*
- Beattie noted that the seams were poorly soldered with lead, which had likely come in direct contact with the food.*
- Farrer argued that "it is impossible to see how one could ingest from the canned food the amount of lead, 3.3 mg per day over eight months, required to raise the PbB to the level 80 μg/dL at which symptoms of lead poisoning begin to appear in adults and the suggestion that bone lead in adults could be 'swamped' by lead ingested from food over a period of a few months, or even three years, seems scarcely tenable."*
- A camera crew filmed the procedure, shown in Nova's television documentary, Buried in Ice in 1988.*
- On 18 June 2015, a study accepted for publication in the Journal of Osteoarchaeology concluded that in addition to the de-fleshing of bones, 35 "bones had signs of breakage and 'pot polishing,' which occurs when the ends of bones heated in boiling water rub against the cooking pot they are placed in", which "typically occurs in the end stage of cannibalism, when starving people extract the marrow to eke out the last bit of calories and nutrition they can."*
- A documentary, "Oceans of Mystery: Search for the Lost Fleet", was produced by Eco-Nova about this expedition.*
- Knowing that ice would delay the transit in the area of King William Island, he offered the use of the Nadon as a search vessel to his friends Hobson and Woodman, and using the Nadon's Kongsberg/Simrad SM2000 forward-looking sonar, the survey of the northern search area around Kirkwall Island was continued without result.*
- In 2002 and 2004, small Franklin artefacts and characteristic explorer tent sites were found on a small islet northeast of O'Reilly Island during shore searches.*
- Grenier also hoped to draw from newly published Inuit testimony collected by oral historian Dorothy Harley Eber.*

- It was discovered by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton,* at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.
- The production method has not changed since the substance was discovered by Corson and Stoughton.*
- Other bases, solvent free methods and microwave promotion have been suggested to improve the production of the substance.*
- In addition, repeated exposure may cause sensitisation.*
- As well as causing severe pulmonary damage, CS can also significantly damage the heart and liver.*
- In Israel, CS gas was reported to be the cause of death of Jawaher Abu Rahmah on 31 December 2010,* although the Israel Defense Forces have questioned the veracity of the report.
- Other reports* suggest the cause of death was in fact the impact of a high-velocity CS gas canister to the chest.
- The solvent in which CS is dissolved, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), is classified as harmful by inhalation; irritating to the eyes and respiratory system; and repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.*
- These, when fired at relatively close ranges, fully expose the target to the effects of CS, and are employed as a potent defensive weapon in regions where blank firing pistols are legally permitted for such use.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkelium">Berkelium</a>
- Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967.*
- This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.*
- No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.*
- The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.*
- The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.*
- The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts.*
- The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.*
- The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.*
- For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.*
- The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long when compared to the other isotopes produced in the reactor,* and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.
- The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including berkelium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.*
- Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: "It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of Ytterby, Sweden, where the rare earth minerals were first found." This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, californium, was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium, but after the discovery place.*
- In a more common case of uranium fuel, plutonium is produced first by neutron capture (the so-called (n,γ) reaction or neutron fusion) followed by beta-decay:*
- The half-life of 248Cf was estimated as 23 ± 5 hours and a more reliable value still is not known.*
- Berkelium-247 was produced during the same year by irradiating 244Cm with alpha-particles:*
- A search for an initially suspected isotope 241Bk was then unsuccessful;* 241Bk has since been synthesized.
- A search for an initially suspected isotope 241Bk was then unsuccessful; 241Bk has since been synthesized.*
- This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.*
- The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA,* and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium elements (atomic number greater than 96).
- The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia,* which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium elements (atomic number greater than 96).
- These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements,* although the quantities produced at NIIAR are not publicly reported.
- In a "typical processing campaign" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium-249 and einsteinium, and picogram quantities of fermium.*
- Similar results are obtained with berkelium(IV) fluoride.*
- Berkelium metal can also be produced by the reduction of berkelium(IV) oxide with thorium or lanthanum.*
- Berkelium(IV) oxide is a brown solid,* while berkelium(III) oxide is a yellow-green solid with a melting point of 1920 °C and is formed from BkO2 by reduction with molecular hydrogen
- Berkelium(IV) fluoride (BkF4) is a yellow-green ionic solid and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconium(IV) fluoride.*
- The most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride, while upon heating to between 350 and 600 °C, it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride.*
- The most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride, while upon heating to between 350 and 600 °C, it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride.*
- This green solid has a melting point of 600 °C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride.*
- This green solid has a melting point of 600 °C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride.*
- The pnictides of berkelium-249 of the type BkX are known for the elements nitrogen,* phosphorus, arsenic and antimony.
- They crystallize in the rock-salt structure and are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium(III) hydride (BkH3) or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperature (about 600 °C) under high vacuum.*
- The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks).*
- It is also useful as a source of the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.*
- In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250.*
- In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease">Wilson's disease</a>
- The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis.*
- Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.*
- A characteristic tremor described as "wing-beating tremor" is encountered in many people with Wilson's; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by extending the arms.*
- It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.*
- Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule.*
- Relatively little is known about the relative impact of various mutations, although the H1069Q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems, according to some studies.*
- This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper.*
- It is not clear why Wilson's disease causes hemolysis, but various lines of evidence suggest that a high level of free (non-ceruloplasmin bound) copper has a direct effect on either oxidation of hemoglobin, inhibition of energy-supplying enzymes in the red blood cell, or direct damage to the cell membrane.*
- Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure.*
- If there are neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting.*
- MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic "face of the giant panda" pattern.*
- Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.*
- This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.*
- The copper chelating treatment may take up to six months to start working, and physical therapy can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.*
- Liver and neurologic damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent.*
- The disease bears the name of the British physician Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1878–1937), a neurologist who described the condition, including the pathological changes in the brain and liver, in 1912.*
- Wilson's work had been predated by, and drew on, reports from German neurologist Carl Westphal (in 1883), who termed it "pseudosclerosis"; by the British neurologist William Gowers (in 1888); and by Adolph Strümpell (in 1898), who noted hepatic cirrhosis.*
- Neuropathologist John Nathaniel Cumings made the link with copper accumulation in both the liver and the brain in 1948.*
- The occurrence of hemolysis was noted in 1967.*
- Cumings, and simultaneously the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, working in the United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951.*
- Cumings, and simultaneously the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, working in the United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951.*
- This treatment had to be injected but was one of the first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer.*
- The first effective oral chelation agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe.*
- In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine,* and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use.
- In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use.*
- Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.*
- The genetic basis of Wilson's disease and linkage to ATP7B mutations was elucidated in the 1980s and 1990s by several research groups.*
- The genetic basis of Wilson's disease and linkage to ATP7B mutations was elucidated in the 1980s and 1990s by several research groups.*
- Hereditary copper accumulation has been described in Bedlington Terriers,* where it generally only affects the liver.
- It is due to mutations in the COMMD1 (or MURR1) gene.*
- In non-Wilsonian copper accumulation states (such as Indian childhood cirrhosis), no COMMD1 mutations could be detected to explain their genetic origin.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_marketing">Green marketing</a>
- In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission provides some guidance on environmental marketing claims.*
- This Commission is expected to do an overall review of this guidance, and the legal standards it contains, in 2011.*
- The term Green Marketing came into prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s.*
- The proceedings of this workshop resulted in one of the first books on green marketing entitled "Ecological Marketing".*
- They were by Ken Peattie (1992) in the United Kingdom and by Jacquelyn Ottman (1993) in the United States of America.*
- According to Jacquelyn Ottman, (author of "The New Rules of Green Marketing: Strategies, Tools, and Inspiration for Sustainable Branding" (Greenleaf Publishing* and Berrett-Koehler Publishers, February 2011)) from an organizational standpoint, environmental considerations should be integrated into all aspects of marketing — new product development and communications and all points in between.
- According to Jacquelyn Ottman, (author of "The New Rules of Green Marketing: Strategies, Tools, and Inspiration for Sustainable Branding" (Greenleaf Publishing and Berrett-Koehler Publishers, February 2011)) from an organizational standpoint, environmental considerations should be integrated into all aspects of marketing — new product development and communications and all points in between.*
- Environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needs.*
- and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and to remain in the forefront of shoppers' minds.*
- One of green marketing's challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes "green," according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing.*
- This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims.*
- This concern has led more companies to advertise their commitment to reduce their climate impacts, and the effect this is having on their products and services.*
- This concern has led more companies to advertise their commitment to reduce their climate impacts, and the effect this is having on their products and services.*
- Although the United States is not participating in the Kyoto Protocol, several US programs enable similar transactions on a voluntary and regulatory basis.*
- While international trade in greenhouse gas* reductions holds substantial promise as a source of new funding for sustainable development, this market can be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects, remote communities, and least developed localities.
- Supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in number–the Energy Star label, for example, now appears on 11,000 different companies'* models in 38 product categories, from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes.
- However, despite the growth in the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products.*
- Shel Horowitz, a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of Guerrilla Marketing Goes Green* states that to market effectively, green businesses need to market to three different audiences, "deep green," "lazy green," and "nongreen", and that each must be approached differently.
- Each will have different trigger points that will move them to buy, and for the nongreen audience, marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet.*
- On the other hand, Roper’s Green Gauge shows that a high percentage of consumers (42%)* feel that environmental products don’t work as well as conventional ones.
- In January 2012, Patagonia became the first brand to register for benefit corporation status.*
- Another 68%* can be classified as Light Greens, consumers who buy green sometimes.
- Today, more than one-third of Americans say they would pay a little extra for green products*
- Complexity: is how difficult the new behavior is to implement.*
- And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.*
- Philips Lighting's first shot at marketing a standalone compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb was Earth Light, at $15 each versus 75 cents for incandescent bulbs.*
- EPA's Energy Star label to add credibility as well as new sensitivity to rising utility costs and electricity shortages, sales climbed 12 percent in an otherwise flat market.*
- Car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares, to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gases.*
- Consumers who drive less than 7,500 miles a year and do not need a car for work can save thousands of dollars annually by joining one of the many services springing up, including Zipcar (East Coast), I-GO Car (Chicago), and Hour Car (Twin Cities).*
- One example of this is HP's promise to cut its global energy use 20 percent by the year 2010.*
- In 2002, a directive was issued to completely adopt CNG in all public transport systems to curb pollution.*

- However, it has earned a fearsome reputation and is sometimes killed despite being protected by state law in Arizona.*
- Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is better placed in a separate family.*
- states of New Mexico and Arizona, where the Gila monster was once plentiful.*
- Suspectum comes from the describer, paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who suspected the lizard might be venomous due to the grooves in the teeth.*
- They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture.*
- In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain.*
- They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.*
- Gila monsters spend 90% of their time underground in burrows or rocky shelters.*
- Gila monsters are slow in sprinting ability, but they have relatively high endurance and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max) for a lizard.*
- The Gila monster eats small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, insects, and carrion.*
- The Gila monster feeds primarily on bird and reptile eggs, and eats infrequently (only five to ten times a year in the wild),* but when it does feed, it may eat up to one-third of its body mass.

- Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.*
- In the Old West, the pioneers believed a number of myths about the Gila monster, including that the lizard had foul or toxic breath and that its bite was fatal.*
- Goodfellow published articles about rattlesnake and Gila monster bites in Scientific American and Southern California Practitioner.*
- No reports of fatalities have been confirmed after 1939, and those recorded prior to that year are possibly iatrogenic, or resulting from attempts to treat the bite itself.*

- After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again.*
- Belgium is the only remaining popular monarchy in the world: The monarch is formally known as the "King of the Belgians", not the "King of Belgium".*
- While in a referendum held on 12 March 1950, 57.68 per cent of the Belgians voted in favor of allowing Léopold III, whose conduct during World War II had been considered questionable and who had been accused of treason, to return to the throne; due to civil unrest, he opted to abdicate in favor of his son Baudouin I on 16 July 1951.*
- Currently, about 70 per cent support keeping the monarchy.*
- While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead.*
- However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely.*
- In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy.*
- Menton and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, part of Monaco until the mid-19th century before seceding in hopes of being annexed by Sardinia, were ceded to France in exchange for 4,000,000 French francs with the Franco-Monegasque Treaty in 1861, which also formally guaranteed Monaco its independence.*

- Support for establishing a republic instead of a monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that there will still be a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist in a century since the poll was done.*
- Some of these realms have significant levels of support for republicanism.*
- There are plans to change to absolute primogeniture in Spain* through a rather complicated processes, as the change entails a constitutional amendment.
- As parliament has to be dissolved and new elections have to be called after the constitutional amendment is passed for the first time, the previous Presidente del Gobierno José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero indicated he would wait until the end of his first term in 2008 before passing the law,* although this deadline passed without the referendum being called.
- The amendment enjoys strong public support.*
- While the Equality Bill was at first expected to both abolish the preference for male heirs as well as the barring of Catholics from the throne at some point in 2008,* this was later changed because of the complexity of agreeing simultaneous legislation in 16 states, and it seemed that there were no concrete plans to change the order of succession in the close future.

- It was later reported that the marriage between Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton might drive change.*
- The heads of government of all 16 states in the Commonwealth of Nations that share the same person as their respective monarch concluded at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011, in what came to be known as the Perth Agreement, to attempt to change the rules to equal primogeniture and also abolish the ban against the monarchy being married to a Roman Catholic).*
- Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture (aka Salic law), which completely excludes women from the order of succession unless there are no male heirs of any kind present, and was criticised for this by a United Nations committee for this perceived gender equality issue in November 2007.*
- Luxembourg also used agnatic primogeniture until 20 June 2011, when absolute primogeniture was introduced.*

- Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32 K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56 K, and paramagnetic above 56 K.*
- Liquid thulium is very volatile.*
- Thulium reacts with various metallic and non-metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds, including TmN, TmS, TmC2, Tm2C3, TmH2, TmH3, TmSi2, TmGe3, TmB4, TmB6 and TmB12.*
- In those compounds, thulium exhibits valence states +2 and +3, however, the +3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in thulium solutions.*
- This oxide is sometimes called "thulia".*
- Some hydrated thulium compounds, such as TmCl3·7H2O and Tm2(C2O4)3·6H2O are green or greenish-white.*
- This reaction results in hydrogen gas and Tm(OH)3 exhibiting a fading reddish color.*
- Combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides.*
- The primary decay products before 169Tm are element 68 (erbium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 70 (ytterbium) isotopes.*
- Most other isotopes have half-lives of a few minutes or less.*
- Thulium's atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm.*
- He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.*
- The price per kilogram has oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium.*

- Thulium-170 is gaining popularity as an X-ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy.*
- Thulium-170 is one of the four most popular radioisotopes for use in industrial radiography.*
- Thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum, in this case, its green emission lines, which are not covered by other elements.*
- Because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light, thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting.*
- Despite this, thulium has a low level of toxicity.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_State_Capitol">Utah State Capitol</a>
- Government created the Territory of Utah as part of the compromise of 1850.*
- The assembly met in various buildings including the Council House, which had originally been constructed to serve as capitol of the provisional State of Deseret, until the first capitol building was constructed.*
- Its centralized location in the territory made it seem an ideal place for Utah's capital city.*
- Funding options in the form of bonds and loans were also researched.*
- On March 13, 1912 the commission made its final vote and selected Richard Kletting's design by a vote of four to three.*
- The cornerstone, dated 1914, was laid at the top of the southern steps, and was filled with records and photographs documenting the building's construction and Utah's culture.*
- The renovation was guided by three main goals, first strengthen the structure to withstand as much as a 7.3 magnitude earthquake, then restore the original architectural and artistic details of the building, all while retaining functionality after the renovation.*
- On August 7, 2004, the day before the capitol closed, a "Capitol Discovery Day" was held, and the public was invited to visit the capitol and learn about the changes being made, and why the project was necessary.*
- These two buildings, constructed north of the capitol, would serve as temporary offices during the structure's restoration.*
- Much of the asbestos on the exterior of the building (used to waterproof the dome) had been removed that summer by inmates from the Utah State Prison, working in the Utah Correctional Industries program.*
- The floor of the rotunda had originally included glass, which allowed light to pass from the skylights down to the first floor, and the glass was restored during the renovations.*
- The isolators are made of layers of laminated rubber, and are very strong vertically but not horizontally, which allows the building to rock gently back and forth as the ground underneath moves during an earthquake.*
- The final cost was $260,000,000 which did not include the construction of two additional legislative office buildings on the capitol campus at a cost of $37,000,000 each.*
- Funds dedicated to the capitol complex make it the costliest state capitol complex in the United States.*
- The Capitol Hill Association, a group of political lobbyists, also rents space in the basement for a lounge.*
- Over time the large open areas of the ground floor were walled in and divided, extending the offices into the public space.*
- When the capitol was opened in 1916 the cyclorama was blank, and was not painted until the 1930s, as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project.*
- The chandelier is an exact copy of one hanging in the Arkansas State Capitol, and during the restoration process Arkansas sent several, period glass diffusers to Utah to replace broken ones found in its chandelier.*

- The deuterocanonical version of the book of Daniel confirms this hypothesis.*
- The Theodotion's version, used by Catholics and Orthodox Christians contains the Prayer of Azariah, an apocryphal prayer added by Hellenistic rabbis in the Septuagint version of the book of Daniel, which curiously mentions Abednego by his other name, Azariah, rather than Abednego* which is used in the whole chapter 3 of the Hebrew and Protestant version, without any mention of the name "Azariah" in this chapter.

- Ground beetles are a large, cosmopolitan family of beetles, Carabidae, with more than 40,000 species worldwide, around 2,000 of which are found in North America and 2,700 in Europe.*
- All carabids except the quite primitive flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) have a groove on their foreleg tibiae bearing a comb of hairs used for cleaning their antennae.*
- In one of the very few known cases of a vertebrate mimicking an arthropod, juvenile Heliobolus lugubris lizards are colored similar to the aposematic oogpister beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.*
- A folk story claims that Charles Darwin once found himself on the receiving end of a bombardier beetle's attack, based on a passage in his autobiography.*

- While no completely firm consensus exists, a few points are generally accepted: As it seems, the ground beetles consist of a number of more basal lineages and the extremely diverse Harpalinae which contain over half the described species and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.*
- The taxonomy used here is based on the Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera* and the Carabidae of the World Database.
- The taxonomy used here is based on the Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera and the Carabidae of the World Database.*
- Other classifications, while generally agreeing with the division into a basal radiation of more primitive lineages and the more advanced group informally called "Carabidae Conjunctae",* differ in details.
- For example, the system used by the Tree of Life Web Project makes little use of subfamilies, listing most tribes as incertae sedis as to subfamily.*
- Fauna Europaea, though, splits rather than lumps the Harpalinae, restricting them to what in the system used here is the tribe Harpalini.*
- All the approaches mentioned above are legitimate as they agree with the phylogeny as far as it has been resolved.*
- Second, the MediaWiki markup cannot at present adequately represent the relationships of the ground beetle subgroups in detail if the restricted view of the Harpalinae is chosen.*

- This edict elevates Christianity on equal status with Confucianism in China.*
- The Kangxi Emperor also hired several Jesuits in his court as scientists and artists.*

- The Controversy debate was most intense between a group of Christian literati and a Catholic Bishop (named Charles Maigrot de Crissey) in Fujian province, with the Chinese group of converts support the Jesuits and the bishop supported by less accommodating Iberian mendicants (Dominicans and Franciscans).*
- Although the Jesuits' defense of Christianity in China was still grounded in the accommodation policy first practiced by Matteo Ricci,* it ended in failure in the eighteenth century: The persecution of Chinese Christians that began with his father's, the Yongzheng Emperor's 1724 proscription of the Heavenly Lord sect (Tianzhujiao, the name given Catholicism in China in that period) steadily increased during the reign of Qianlong Emperor.

- At the isolated Saint Peter and Paul Rocks along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the resident Galapagos sharks have been described as "one of the densest shark populations of the Atlantic Ocean".*
- The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision.*
- A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin.*
- In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.*
- As the sharks grow larger, they consume increasing numbers of elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage.*
