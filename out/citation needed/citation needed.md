#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War">Greek Civil War</a>
- Western leaders (Winston Churchill in particular) encouraged and even coerced* King George II of Greece to appoint a moderate cabinet.
- The communist leaders of EAM, however, had planned to dominate in postwar Greece, so, usually by force, they tried to take over or destroy the other Greek resistance groups (such as the destruction of National and Social Liberation (EKKA) and the murder of its leader, Dimitrios Psarros by ELAS partisans)* and undertaking a campaign of Red Terror.
- Although controlled by the KKE, the organization had democratic republican rhetoric.*
- The Greek landscape was favourable to guerrilla operations, and by 1943, the Axis forces and their collaborators were in control only of the main towns and connecting roads, leaving the mountainous countryside to the resistance.*
- EAM-ELAS in particular controlled most of the country's mountainous interior, while EDES was limited to Epirus and EKKA to eastern Central Greece.*
- By early 1944 ELAS could call on nearly 25,000 men under arms, with another 80,000 working as reserves or logistical support, EDES roughly 10,000 men, and EKKA under 10,000 men.*
- The role of the British military mission in these events proved decisive.*
- Consequently, British material support was directed mostly to the more reliable Zervas, who by 1943 had reversed his earlier anti-monarchist stance.*
- They declined to join the ranks of ELAS and were systematically murdered by the Communists*.
- Its political network (EAM) had reached about 500,000 citizens around the country.*

- Farmakis, a member of the Organization X participating in the shootings, described that he heard the head of the police Angelos Evert giving the order to open fire on the crowd.*
- In certain cases, such as Volos, some RAF units even surrendered equipment to ELAS fighters.*
- It seems that the ELAS preferred to avoid an armed confrontation with the British forces initially and later tried to reduce the conflict as much as possible although poor communication between its very independent units around the country might also have played a role.*
- If not, he could use British actions in Greece to justify similar actions in countries in his own sphere of influence.*
- Despite the severe defeat, ELAS continued to exist, and the KKE had an opportunity to reconsider its strategy.*

- The TSG applies only to German citizens; there are exceptions only for non-German citizens with very specific legal status, such as stateless people living legally in Germany, or in case the foreign state has no equivalent law, which would be in accordance with German constitution.*
- Also, people with only a name change do not have to divulge their legal gender to employers.*
- Grodzka is reportedly the only transsexual person with ministerial responsibilities in the world since 10 November 2011.*
- People who thought that they had existing valid marriages, turned out not to, and the previous unofficial changing of birth certificates was stopped.*
- Even so, transsexual people were able to change their names freely, to have their passports and driving licences altered, to have their National Insurance details changed, and so forth,* and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made it illegal to discriminate on the ground of anatomical sex in employment, education and the provision of housing, goods, facilities and services.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_theology">Seventh-day Adventist theology</a>
- According to Ed Christian, former JATS editor, "few if any ATS members believe in verbal inerrancy".*
- This was particularly true in the early days of the movement, when it was assumed that most people the church witnessed to were already Christian to begin with, and that they already understood the gospel.*
- The Sabbath is also a time for Adventists to spend with other people and with God.*
- It should be noted, however, that although Seventh-day Adventists do not believe that they are saved by keeping Saturday as the Sabbath, they attach considerably greater significance to Saturday-Sabbath keeping than other denominations attach to worship on Sunday.*
- The Sabbath commandment is seen as an act of faith in God's ideal for the believer, although its significance may not be seen by non-believers.*
- They believe that the Sabbath is a whole day dedicated for worship and fellowship with believers, laying aside non-religious projects and labor.*
- This change became more universally accepted with the establishment of Roman emperor Constantine's Sunday law of 321 AD and the decree at the Council of Laodicea that in canon 29 declared that Christians should avoid work on Sunday.*
- God has permitted Lucifer's rebellion to continue on Earth in order to demonstrate to angels and beings on other worlds that his Law is righteous and necessary, and that the breaking of the 10 commandments leads to moral catastrophe.*
- White, particularly chapter 29, The Origin of Evil is also sometimes referenced.*
- Adventists hold that Christ ministered his blood in the first section of the sanctuary (the holy place) until October 1844; after that time he entered the second section of the sanctuary (the Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies) in fulfillment of the Day of Atonement.*
- Adventists therefore believe that Christ's work of atonement encompasses both his death on the Cross and his ministration in the heavenly sanctuary.*
- Adventists believe that the unrighteous, or wicked, will be raised after the millennium.*
- The time of trouble will be ended by the glorious appearing of Christ, which will also mark the commencement of the millennium.*
- A further difference is that the millennial reign of Christ will take place in heaven, not on earth, and will involve all of the redeemed people of God, not just national Israel.*
- Seventh-day Adventism interprets the book of Revelation using the historicist method, but also holds that some of the events it predicts are still future (see: interpretations of the Book of Revelation).*
- These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.*
- The theological term for this teaching is Annihilationism.*
- Adventist education hence strives to be holistic in nature, involving not just the mind but all aspects of a person.*
- Whatever the prominence assigned to her writings for doctrinal authority, Adventists are agreed that the Bible takes precedence as the final authority.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Solipsism</a>
- Based on a philosophy of subjective idealism, metaphysical solipsists maintain that the self is the only existing reality and that all other reality, including the external world and other persons, are representations of that self, and have no independent existence.*
- Epistemological solipsists claim that realism requires the question: assuming that there is a universe independent of an agent's mind and knowable only through the agent's senses, how is the existence of this independent universe to be scientifically studied?* If a person sets up a camera to photograph the moon when he is not looking at it, then at best he determines that there is an image of the moon in the camera when he eventually looks at it.
- To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question.*
- Methodological solipsism is an agnostic variant of solipsism*.
- It still entertains the points that any induction is fallible and that we may be brains in vats*.
- Descartes' cartesian skepticism).*
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise* brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist.
- The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than "I think; therefore I exist" without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist*.
- The experience of a given person is necessarily private to that person.*
- And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since Descartes elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the primary goal of epistemology, whilst also elevating epistemology to "first philosophy".*
- Solipsism is often introduced in the context of relating it to pathological psychological conditions.*
- The lack of ability to prove the existence of other minds does not, in itself, cause the psychiatric condition of detachment from reality.*
- This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that methodology assumes that humans have no access to omniscience and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via scientific and logical conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.*
- The solipsist, however, would be more likely to put one's self (or merely their own mind) in the center, as the only item of reality, with all other beings (and perhaps even their own body) in reality illusions.*
- Taoism* and several interpretations of Buddhism, especially Zen, teach that the distinction between self and universe is arbitrary, merely a habit of perception and an artifact of language.
- After the development of distinct schools of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.*
- On the other hand, solipsism posits the non-existence of the external void right at the beginning, and says that no further inquiry is possible.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia">Cobb County, Georgia</a>
- Most runoff flows into the Middle Chattahoochee-Lake Harding and Upper Chattahoochee River sub-basins of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin) along the southeastern border, directly via Willeo Creek, Sope Creek (Sewell Creek), Rottenwood Creek (Powers Creek, Poorhouse Creek, Poplar Creek), Nickajack Creek and others.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol">Estradiol</a>
- One principle pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy derivative, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and then to Δ4-androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations.*
- Action of aromatase on Δ4-androstenedione generates estrone, and action of a dehydrogenase on this gives the title compound, 17β-estradiol.*
- Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.*
- Fat structure and skin composition are modified by estradiol.*
- It affects the production of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting.*
- In addition, several benign gynecologic conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, and uterine bleeding.*
- They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors.*
- This is often prescribed in combination with clomifene.*
- Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.*
- Soybeans are another bean that contains chemicals that act similarly to estrogen in the human body and also cause such interactions.*
- As the name implies, estradiol, sometimes abbreviated as E2, has two hydroxyl groups in its molecular structure; its relatives estrone (E1) and estriol (E3) have one and three, respectively, and estetrol (E4) has four.*
- Based on its unique chemical structure, estradiol is about 10 times as potent as estrone and about 80 times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic effect.*
- During the reproductive years of the human female, its serum levels are somewhat higher than that of estrone, except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity.*
- During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, estrone predominates (both based on serum levels).*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus">Simon Magus</a>
- Surviving traditions about Simon appear in orthodox texts, such as those of Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius, where he is often regarded as the source of all heresies*.
- According to the early church heresiologists, Simon is also supposed to have written several lost treatises, two of which bear the titles The Four Quarters of the World and The Sermons of the Refuter.*
- In apocryphal works including the Acts of Peter, Pseudo-Clementines, and the Epistle of the Apostles, Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will.*
- The different sources for information on Simon contain quite different pictures of him, so much so that it has been questioned whether they all refer to the same person.*
- Some scholars have considered the two to be identical, although this is not generally accepted, as the Simon of Josephus is a Jew rather than a Samaritan.*
- Justin and Irenaeus are the first to recount the myth of Simon and Helen, which became the center of Simonian doctrine.*
- Special to the Simonian tale is the identification of Simon himself with the Supreme, and of his consort Helena with the female principle.*
- Some believe that Hippolytus' account is of a later, more developed form of Simonianism, and that the original doctrines of the group were simpler, close to the account given by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus (this account however is also included in Hippolytus' work).*
- But he also adds, "if any one, on seeing the images either of Simon or Helen, shall call them by those names, he is cast out, as showing ignorance of the mysteries."*
- The Law, according to him, was not of God, but of "the sinister power." The same was the case with the prophets, and it was death to believe in the Old Testament.*
- Cyril of Jerusalem (346 AD) in the sixth of his Catechetical Lectures prefaces his history of the Manichaeans by a brief account of earlier heresies: Simon Magus, he says, had given out that he was going to be translated to heaven, and was actually careening through the air in a chariot drawn by demons when Peter and Paul knelt down and prayed, and their prayers brought him to earth a mangled corpse.*
- They are of uncertain date and authorship, and seem to have been worked over by several hands in the interest of diverse forms of belief.*
- He did indeed preach righteousness and judgment to come.*
- A description is given of how he made a familiar spirit for himself by conjuring the soul out of a boy and keeping his image in his bedroom, and many instances of his feats of magic are given.*

- Peavy then won five consecutive starts with a 1.99 ERA.*
- Peavy became the first starting pitcher in MLB history to win two consecutive World Series with two different teams in two different leagues.*
- Peavy likes to run his fastballs in on lefties and make the pitch break back into the zone, similar to a power version of Greg Maddux's technique.*

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Cornwall">Culture of Cornwall</a>
- Although less than 1% of Cornwall's population speak the language and 'mother tongue' speakers are in their hundreds rather than thousands, the language continues to play a significant part in the culture of Cornwall.*
- Historic records of authentic Cornish mythology or history are hard to verify but the earliest Cornish language (such as the Bodmin manumissions) marks the separation of Primitive Cornish from Old Welsh often dated to the Battle of Deorham in 577.*
- Due to language erosion and possible suppression caused by the dominant English language* and culture in the later medieval period, many works of Cornish language are thought to have been lost, particularly at the time of the dissolution of the religious houses of (Glasney College and Crantock College for example), which were regarded as repertories of 'Welsh' (i.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannadice_Park">Tannadice Park</a>
- The name of the ground was changed to Tannadice when Dundee Hibernian took over the lease in 1909.*
- The Hibs committee made an offer to the landlords which exceeded what Wanderers were paying; as a result, the established tenants were informed that their lease would not be renewed for the coming season.*
- The original capacity of Tannadice Park was around 10,000, the terracings were specially extended and additional temporary seating erected for a Qualifying Cup-tie against Forfar Athletic in 1913; all of this was necessary to allow a record crowd to be accommodated, and the reported attendance was 15,000.*
- This was opened in 1971 and overlooked the pitch, something that is now a common sight in football grounds across the country.*
- Unfortunately the first time the under-soil heating was called into action was when a fairly heavy snowfall started during the UEFA Cup 3rd round first leg tie against Neuchâtel Xamax on 27 November 1985 and the system failed.*
- In 2009, the traditional flood lights were removed and replaced with a brighter roof mounted lighting system, and in 2010 the original wooden seats in the Jerry Kerr stand were removed and replaced with tangerine plastic seating.*
- The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.*
- With season ticket holders now accommodated in the more modern parts of the stadium, the Shed can be allocated to either home or away supporters as demand dictates.*
- It is allocated to home supporters.*
- Cup ties tended to attract higher attendances in this era, and after the terraces were specially extended to accommodate the expected large crowd, 15,000 watched a Scottish Qualifying Cup tie against Forfar Athletic on 1 November 1913.*
- Then a much larger than anticipated crowd of 23,517 packed in to watch an important late season Tayside derby against St Johnstone on 17 April 1926, with both clubs fighting relegation.*
- Since then, in common with many other grounds, safety legislation and conversion to all-seating has drastically reduced Tannadice's capacity, with the modern stadium holding little over half that number.*

- Left to defend* Rangoon from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated.
- Although Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force,* having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the Battle of Imphal.
- However, INA's most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, -which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA's and the Japanese bid to take Imphal.*

- And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.*
- Car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares, to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gases.*

- For univariate distributions that are symmetric about one median, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population pseudo-median, which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median.*
- An image constructed of median values of neighborhoods (like 3×3 square) can effectively reduce noise in this case.*
