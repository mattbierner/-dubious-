- On 15 December, the Brescia Division held its ground at the Ayn al Ghazālah (Gazala) against the attacking 2nd New Zealand Division and Polish Brigade, allowing a strong Italo-German armoured force to counterattack and overrun the 1st British Battalion, The Buffs.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- During the brief siege of Mersa Matruh in late June 1942, the Brescia with the Trento Division and Bersaglieri troops played an important part, in the capture of 6,000 defenders of the Xth British Corps, along with large quantities of supplies.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- During the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942, the Brescia deployed on El Mreir, repelled a strong force of the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade in the initial fighting,and during the defence of Ruweisat Rige, the 19th Regiment of the Brescia put up a tenacious defence, losing a battalion and three company commanders in the night action, before being partly overcome at dawn on July 15, delaying the Allied advance for several hours and allowing German armoured forces to launch a devastating counteratack<sup>[dubious]</sup> During the 21 July, 1942, until 27 July, 1942, the British counter-attacks has become so severe what the Brescia division has ultimately stopped to the south of El Alamein.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_detention">Soft detention</a>
- Traditionally, and in modern practice, there are three levels of restriction; the loosest, "juzhu,"<sup>[dubious]</sup> restricts the detainee to their home district.
- This restriction was employed on the history teacher Yuan Tengfei who included information about banned aspects of modern Chinese history in his lectures.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The second level, “anzhi,”<sup>[dubious]</sup> employed anciently on Su Shi, restricts the prisoner to their home, but they may be allowed to go for a walk or go to work.
- The severest form, “bianguan,”<sup>[dubious]</sup> which was imposed on the human rights activist Chen Guangcheng involves limited movement of the prisoner to their home, constant surveillance, restriction of contract with others, and, sometimes, harassment.

- Gaseous elements and compounds will dissolve in liquids dependent on the interaction of their bonds with the liquid solvent.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Gaseous elements and compounds may also dissolve in another liquid depending on the compatibility of the chemical and physical bonds in the substance with those of the solvent.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Crystalline solids dissolve with breakdown of their crystal lattice, and due to their polarity, or non-polarity, mix with the solvent.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The solubility of polymers depends on the chemical bonds present in the backbone chain and their compatibility with those of the solvent.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid-leak_detector">Grid-leak detector</a>
- A valve has a resistor connected from grid to ground, typically as the only bias component.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- When the grid leak stage had a transformer input, the valve grid connected to one end of the transformer secondary, and the other end of the secondary went to ground via the grid leak resistor and a small bypass capacitor.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The use of grid leak bias competed with use of a so-called C battery for providing a fixed negative voltage on the grid.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The grid bias produced by the grid leak across the biassing grid leak resistor, plus the typically non-linear characteristic of the valves chosen, result in a non-linear rf amplifying stage.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Dacia">Roman Dacia</a>
- Some modern authors write that Caracalla added further territory to Dacia by pushing the border around 50 kilometres east of the Olt river.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The native Dacians retained their names and their cultural distinctiveness<sup>[dubious]</sup> even with the increasing embrace of Roman cultural norms which followed their incorporation into the empire.
- It may be that the Dacians lacked an anthropomorphic conception of deity, and that the Thraco-Dacian religion was characterized by aniconism comparable to that of Judaism and Islam.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Toponymic analysis of place-names in Dacia suggests that the Slavs possibly took at least some place-names from an un-Romanized Dacian population.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambing_Flat_riots">Lambing Flat riots</a>
- European resentment of the apparent success of the Chinese<sup>[dubious]</sup> first surfaced as petty complaints: Europeans made stereotyped claims that the Chinese muddied the water holes, they worked on the Sabbath, they were thieves, they had insanitary habits, they accepted low wages and would drive down the value of labour.
- The most notorious of these incidents, and the one which has generated more folklore<sup>[dubious]</sup> than any other, was the so-called Lambing Flat Riot, actually a drawn-out series of incidents on the Burrangong Goldfield in New South Wales between November 1860 and September 1861.
- Then in 1860 the Chinese and British governments signed the Convention of Peking, a diplomatic agreement that subjects of the Chinese and British Empires would have reciprocal rights under their respective countries' laws.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The popular impression of the riots as a savage assault on the Chinese by European miners is a mere thumbnail sketch, greatly understating the complexity of what happened there.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_age">Astrological age</a>
- During this mythological age writing developed,<sup>[dubious]</sup> and trade started to accelerate.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">Emulator</a>
- However, the speed penalty inherent in interpretation can be a problem when emulating computers whose processor speed is on the same order of magnitude as the host machine<sup>[dubious]</sup>.
- Until not many years ago, emulation in such situations was considered completely impractical by many<sup>[dubious]</sup>.
- What allowed breaking through this restriction were the advances in dynamic recompilation techniques<sup>[dubious]</sup>.
- The translated code is kept in a code cache<sup>[dubious]</sup>, and the original code is not lost or affected; this way, even data segments can be (meaninglessly) translated by the recompiler, resulting in no more than a waste of translation time.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Dalet">Plan Dalet</a>
- It was designed to enhance Zionist military and police mobilisation and enable action as needed.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Its overall objective was to seize as much territory as possible<sup>[dubious]</sup> in advance of the termination of the British Mandate — when the Zionist leaders planned to declare their state.
- The sanguinary impasse persisted as no force intervened to put a stop to the escalating cycles of violence.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- According to Benny Morris the Plan's execution lasted about eight weeks<sup>[dubious]</sup>, beginning April 2.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Schleswig-Holstein">History of Schleswig-Holstein</a>
- The Prussian police, indeed, developed an almost superhuman capacity for detecting optants: and since these pariahs<sup>[dubious]</sup> were mingled indistinguishably with the mass of the people, no household and no business was safe from official inquisition.
- One instance, out of many, may serve to illustrate the type of offence that served as excuse for this systematic official persecution.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- This adjustment, brought about by the friendly intercourse between the courts<sup>[dubious]</sup> of Berlin and Copenhagen, seemed to close the last phase of the Schleswig question.
- The autochthonous Germans of the Northern Marches regarded the new treaty as a betrayal, and refused to give the kiss of peace to their hereditary enemies.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_persecution_of_Alevis">Ottoman persecution of Alevis</a>
- Suppression has also been one of the reasons that Alevis often held their religious assemblies (ayin-i cem) at nights.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Tunceli is the province with the highest percentage of Alevis in Turkey and is known for being a "hard penetratable" and barren mountain area.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- This has resulted in Alevis repeatedly being subjected to verbal attacks and violations in public and on television.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Many Alevis therefore demand a more tolerant and diversity conscious approach that can recognize and accept Alevis as they are, instead of being redefined and constantly questioned.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_warfare">Ancient Greek warfare</a>
- When in combat, the whole formation would consistently press forward trying to break the enemy formation; thus, when two phalanx formations engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match,<sup>[dubious]</sup> in which, as a rule, the deeper phalanx would almost always win, with few recorded exceptions.
- Failing that, a battle degenerated into a pushing match, with the men in the rear trying to force the front lines through those of the enemy.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Battles rarely lasted more than an hour.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

- Although the boundaries of Whole Azerbaijan are not strictly defined, some proponents portray them as encompassing the following areas<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange">Medium of exchange</a>
- The fact that a bank or mint has always been able to generate a medium of exchange marked for more units than it is worth as a store of value, is the basis of banking.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- Central banking is based on the principle that no medium needs more than the guarantee of the state that it can be redeemed for payment of debt as "legal tender" - thus, all money equally backed by the state is good money, within that state.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- A medium is just that, a medium, and should not be confused for the message.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_work">Piece work</a>
- As a term and as a common form of labor, 'piece work' had its origins in the guild system of work during the Commercial Revolution<sup>[dubious]</sup> and before the Industrial Revolution.
- In the English system of manufacturing, workers mass-produced parts from a fixed design as part of a division of labor, but did not have the advantage of machine tools or metalworking jigs.Simply counting the number of pieces produced by a worker was likely easier than accounting for that worker's time, as would have been required for the computation of an hourly wage.<sup>[dubious]</sup>
- The reality of the earlier English system had been that handcrafted pieces rarely fit together on the first try, and a single artisan was ultimately required to rework all parts of a finished good.<sup>[dubious]</sup>

- Disjuncts (also called sentence adverbs) are useful in colloquial speech<sup>[dubious]</sup> for the concision they permit.
- Bill Bryson says, "those writers who scrupulously avoid 'hopefully' in such constructions do not hesitate to use at least a dozen other words – 'apparently', 'presumably', 'happily', 'sadly', 'mercifully', 'thankfully', and so on – in precisely the same way." What has changed, however, in the controversy<sup>[dubious]</sup> over "hopefully" being used for "he was hoping that .
